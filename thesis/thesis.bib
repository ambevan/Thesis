The ratio of the probabilities for these two transitions is found to change by up to 5 per cent compared with previous theoretical work, none of which included these relativistic corrections, with the effect being largest for the near neutral ions. The transition probability ratio for the [O III] 5007 and 4959 Angstrom lines is found to be 3.01, implying an intensity ratio of 2.98, in significantly better agreement with the observed ratio than the earlier theoretical work.},

@article{Smith2012,
abstract = {Type IIn SNe show spectral evidence for strong interaction between their blast wave and dense circumstellar material (CSM) around the progenitor star. SN2010jl was the brightest core-collapse SN in 2010, and it was a Type IIn explosion with strong CSM interaction. Andrews et al. recently reported evidence for an IR excess in SN2010jl, indicating either new dust formation or the heating of CSM dust in an IR echo. Here we report multi-epoch spectra of SN2010jl that reveal the tell-tale signature of new dust formation: emission-line profiles becoming systematically more blueshifted as the red side of the line is blocked by increasing extinction. The effect is seen clearly in the intermediate-width (400--4000 km/s) component of H\$\backslash alpha\$ beginning roughly 30d after explosion. Moreover, we present near-IR spectra demonstrating that the asymmetry in the hydrogen-line profiles is wavelength dependent, appearing more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. This evidence suggests that new dust grains had formed quickly in the post-shock shell of SN 2010jl arising from CSM interaction. Since the observed dust temperature has been attributed to an IR echo and not to new dust, either (1) IR excess emission at \$\backslash lambda < 5 \backslash mu\$m is not a particularly sensitive tracer of new dust formation in SNe, or (2) some assumptions about expected dust temperatures might require further study. Lastly, we discuss one possible mechanism other than dust that might lead to increasingly blueshifted line profiles in SNeIIn, although the wavelength dependence of the asymmetry argues against this hypothesis in the case of SN2010jl.},

abstract = {The first results on the optical constants of three different amorphous carbon samples, possible analogues of interstellar and circumstellar dust grains, are presented. They have been deduced from recent laboratory data, making use of the Kramers-Kronig approach, It is shown that the physically correct simulation of clustering by the traditional `CDE' model is not applicable here. A modified CDE (MCDE) model is proposed and used in the present calculations. The MCDE model allows one to take into account the effect of percolation of the analysed amorphous carbon clusters through the parameter g(o), interpreted as a percolation strength, The intervals of the probable MCDE models (g(o)) have been chosen on the basis of the relevant estimates of Stognienko, Henning \& Ossenkopf for the cluster-cluster aggregation (CCA) and particle-cluster aggregation (PCA) models. The `optimal' percolation strengths and optical constants have been derived by using a least-squares procedure.},

This theory is used to calculate the time evolution of the hydrogen lines of SN 1987A at t equal to or greater than 150 days, assuming that the supernova envelope is a homologously expanding uniform sphere. The theoretical luminosities and ratios of the recombination lines agree remarkably well with the observations. For the first 2 yr, the supernova envelope is optically thick to Balmer continuum. For t equal to or less than 400 days, hydrogen is ionized primarily from the n = 2 level by Balmer continuum photons, which are provided partly by the two-photon decay of the 2s state and partly by emission lines of heavy elements.},

@article{Ercolano2007,
abstract = {We present a study of the effects of clumping on the emergent spectral energy distribution (SED) from dusty supernova (SN) shells illuminated by a diffuse radiation source distributed throughout the medium. (...) The fully 3D radiation transport problem is solved using a Monte Carlo code, MOCASSIN, and we present a set of models aimed at investigating the sensitivity of the SEDs to various clumping parameters. We find that, contrary to the predictions of analytical prescriptions, the combination of an optical and IR observational data set is sufficient to constrain dust masses even in the case where optically thick clumps are present. Using both smoothly varying and clumped grain density distributions, we obtain new estimates for the mass of dust condensed by the Type II SN 1987A by fitting the optical and infrared spectrophotometric data of Wooden et al. (1993) at two epochs (day 615 and day 775). (...) From our numerical models we derive dust masses for SN 1987A that are comparable to previous analytic clumped graphite grain mass estimates, and at least two orders of magnitude below the 0.1-0.3 Msol that have been predicted to condense as dust grains in primordial core collapse supernova ejecta. This low condensation efficiency for SN 1987A is in contrast to the case of SN 2003gd, for which a dust condensation efficiency as large as 0.12 has recently been estimated. (Abridged)},

Absorption cross-sections are evaluated for graphite and silicate particles with sizes between 0.003 and 1.0 microns, and wavelengths from 300 A to 1000 microns. On the basis of polarization profiles computed for both prolate and oblate graphite-silicate spheroids, it is concluded that interstellar silicate grain are predominantly oblate. Extinction curves are calculated for Mathis-Rumpl-Nordsieck graphite-silicate grain mixtures and are compared to observations.

These include coronal lines from [Fe X], [Fe XI] and [Fe XIV] which have increased by a factor of about 20 during the observed period. The evolution of the lines is similar to that of the soft X-rays, indicating that they arise in the same component. The line ratios are consistent with those expected from radiative shocks with velocity 310-390 km/s, corresponding to a shock temperature of (1.6-2.5) x 10\^{}6 K.

We also measured the velocity at two positions of the ORs to test a geometrical model for the rings. Additionally, we used data from the HST science archives to check the evolution of the ORs of SN 1987A for a period that covers almost 11 years. We measured the flux in four different regions, two for each outer ring. We chose regions away from the two bright foreground stars, and as far as possible from the ER, and we created light curves for the emission lines of [O III], H\{$\backslash$alpha\}, and [N II]. The profiles of the lightcurves display a declining behaviour, which is consistent with the initial supernova flash powering of the ORs. The electron density of the emitting gas in the ORs, as estimated through nebular analysis from forbidden [O II] and [S II] lines, is <= 3*10\^{}3 cm\^{}-3, has not changed over the last \~{} 15 years, and also the [N II] temperature remains fairly constant at \~{} 1.2*10\^{}4 K. We find no obvious difference in density and temperature for the two ORs. The highest density, as measured from the decay of H\{$\backslash$alpha\}, could, however, be \~{} 5*10\^{}3 cm\^{}-3, and since the decay is somewhat faster for the southern outer ring than for the northern, the highest density in the ORs may be found in the southern outer ring. For an assumed distance of 50 kpc to the supernova, the distance between the supernova and the closest parts of the ORs could be as short as \~{} 1.7*10\^{}18 cm. Interaction between the supernova ejecta and the outer rings could therefore start in less than \~{} 20 years. We do not expect the ORs to show the same optical display as the equatorial ring when this happens.},

abstract = {We discuss high resolution VLT/UVES observations (FWHM \~{} 6 km/s) from October 2002 (day \~{}5700 past explosion) of the shock interaction of SN 1987A and its circumstellar ring. A nebular analysis of the narrow lines from the unshocked gas indicates gas densities of (1.5-5.0)E3 cm-3 and temperatures of 6.5E3-2.4E4 K. This is consistent with the thermal widths of the lines. From the shocked component we observe a large range of ionization stages from neutral lines to [Fe XIV]. From a nebular analysis we find that the density in the low ionization region is 4E6-1E7 cm-3. There is a clear difference in the high velocity extension of the low ionization lines and that of lines from [Fe X-XIV], with the latter extending up to \~{} -390 km/s in the blue wing for [Fe XIV], while the low ionization lines extend to typically \~{} -260 km/s. For H-alpha a faint extension up to \~{} -450 km/s can be seen probably arising from a small fraction of shocked high density clumps. We discuss these observations in the context of radiative shock models, which are qualitatively consistent with the observations. A fraction of the high ionization lines may originate in gas which has yet not had time to cool down, explaining the difference in width between the low and high ionization lines. The maximum shock velocities seen in the optical lines are \~{} 510 km/s. We expect the maximum width of especially the low ionization lines to increase with time.},

abstract = {Ground-based optical spectra and Hubble Space Telescope images of ten core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) obtained several years to decades after outburst are analyzed with the aim of understanding the general properties of their late-time emissions. New observations of SN 1957D, 1970G, 1980K, and 1993J are included as part of the study. Blueshifted line emissions in oxygen and/or hydrogen with conspicuous line substructure are a common and long-lasting phenomenon in the late-time spectra. Followed through multiple epochs, changes in the relative strengths and velocity widths of the emission lines are consistent with expectations for emissions produced by interaction between SN ejecta and the progenitor star's circumstellar material. The most distinct trend is an increase in the strength of [O III]/([O I]+[O II]) with age, and a decline in Halpha/([O I]+[O II]) which is broadly consistent with the view that the reverse shock has passed through the H envelope of the ejecta in many of these objects. We also present a spatially integrated spectrum of the young Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). Similarities observed between the emission line profiles of the 330 yr old Cas A remnant and decades old CCSNe suggest that observed emission line asymmetry in evolved CCSN spectra may be associated with dust in the ejecta, and that minor peak substructure typically interpreted as 'clumps' or 'blobs' of ejecta may instead be linked with large-scale rings of SN debris.},

In 2012 we used the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array to observe SN 1987A, one of the best-observed supernovae since the invention of the telescope. We present spatially resolved images at 450 $\mu$m, 870 $\mu$m, 1.4 mm, and 2.8 mm, an important transition wavelength range. Longer wavelength emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation from shock-accelerated particles, shorter wavelengths by emission from the largest mass of dust measured in a supernova remnant (>0.2 M \&\#9737;). For the first time we show unambiguously that this dust has formed in the inner ejecta (the cold remnants of the exploded star's core). The dust emission is concentrated at the center of the remnant, so the dust has not yet been affected by the shocks. If a significant fraction survives, and if SN 1987A is typical, supernovae are important cosmological dust producers.},

abstract = {We present a new analysis of the infrared (IR) emission from the ejecta of SN1987A covering days 615, 775, 1144, 8515, and 9090 after the explosion. We show that the observations are consistent with the rapid formation of about 0.4 Msun of dust, consisting of mostly silicates, near day 615, and evolving to about 0.45 Msun of composite dust grains consisting of \~{}0.4 Msun of silicates and \~{} 0.05 Msun of amorphous carbon after day \~{}8500. The proposed scenario challenges previous claims that dust in SN ejecta is predominantly carbon, and that it grew from an initial mass of \~{}1e-3 Msun, to over 0.5 Msun by cold accretion. It alleviates several problems with previous interpretations of the data: (1) it reconciles the abundances of silicon, magnesium, and carbon with the upper limits imposed by nucleosynthesis calculations; (2) it eliminates the requirement that most of the dust observed around day 9000 grew by cold accretion onto the1e-3 Msun of dust previously inferred for days 615 and 775 after the explosion; and (3) establishes the dominance of silicate over carbon dust in the SN ejecta. At early epochs, the IR luminosity of the dust is powered by the radioactive decay of 56Co, and at late times by at least (1.3-1.6)e-4 Msun 44Ti. Even if only a fraction greater than \~{}10\% of the silicate dust survives the injection into the ISM, the observations firmly establish the role of core collapse SNe as the major source of thermally condensed silicate dust in the universe.},

abstract = {SN 2004et is one of the nearest and best-observed Type IIP supernovae, with a progenitor detection as well as good photometric and spectroscopic observational coverage well into the nebular phase. Based on nucleosynthesis from stellar evolution/explosion models we apply spectral modeling to analyze its 140-700 day evolution from ultraviolet to mid-infrared. We find a MZAMS = 15 M⊙ progenitor star (with an oxygen mass of 0.8 M⊙) to satisfactorily reproduce [O i] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364 and other emission lines of carbon, sodium, magnesium, and silicon, while 12 M⊙ and 19 M⊙ models under- and overproduce most of these lines, respectively. This result is in fair agreement with the mass derived from the progenitor detection, but in disagreement with hydrodynamical modeling of the early-time light curve. From modeling of the mid-infrared iron-group emission lines, we determine the density of the "Ni-bubble" to $\rho$(t) ≃ 7 × 10-14 × (t/100 d)-3 g cm-3, corresponding to a filling factor of f = 0.15 in the metal core region (V = 1800 km s-1). We also confirm that silicate dust, CO, and SiO emission are all present in the spectra. Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

abstract = {SN 2007od exhibits characteristics that have rarely been seen in a Type IIP supernova (SN). Optical V band photometry reveals a very steep brightness decline between the plateau and nebular phases of \~{}4.5 mag, likely due to SN 2007od containing a low mass of 56Ni. The optical spectra show an evolution from normal Type IIP with broad Halpha emission, to a complex, four component Halpha emission profile exhibiting asymmetries caused by dust extinction after day 232. This is similar to the spectral evolution of the Type IIn SN 1998S, although no early-time narrow (\~{}200 km s-1) Halpha component was present in SN 2007od. In both SNe, the intermediate-width Halpha emission components are thought to arise in the interaction between the ejecta and its circumstellar medium (CSM). SN 2007od also shows a mid-IR excess due to new dust. The evolution of the Halpha profile and the presence of the mid-IR excess provide strong evidence that SN 2007od formed new dust before day 232. Late-time observations reveal a flattening of the visible lightcurve. This flattening is a strong indication of the presence of a light echo, which likely accounts for much of the broad, underlying Halpha component seen at late-times. We believe the multi-peaked Halpha emission is consistent with the interaction of the ejecta with a circumstellar ring or torus (for the inner components at $\backslash$pm1500 km s-1), and a single blob or cloud of circumstellar material out of the plane of the CSM ring (for the outer component at -5000 km s-1). The most probable location for the formation of new dust is in the cool dense shell created by the interaction between the expanding ejecta and its CSM. Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling of the dust emission from SN 2007od implies that up to 4x 10-4Msun of new dust has formed. This is similar to the amounts of dust formed in other CCSNe such as SNe 1999em, 2004et, and 2006jc.},

Using an idealized setup of a planar shock impacting a dense, spherical clump, we implant a population of Lagrangian particles into the clump to represent a distribution of dust grains in size and composition. We vary the relative velocity between the reverse shock and ejecta clump to explore the effects of shock heating and cloud compression. Because supernova ejecta will be metal-enriched, we consider gas metallicities from Z/Z ⊙ = 1 to 100 and their influence on the cooling properties of the cloud and the thermal sputtering rates of embedded dust grains. We post-process the simulation output to calculate grain sputtering for a variety of species and size distributions. In the metallicity regime considered in this paper, the balance between increased radiative cooling and increased grain erosion depends on the impact velocity of the reverse shock. For slow shocks (v shock <= 3000 km s-1), the amount of dust destruction is comparable across metallicities or in some cases is decreased with increased metallicity. For higher shock velocities (v shock >= 5000 km s-1), an increase in metallicity from Z/Z ⊙ = 10 to 100 can lead to an additional 24\% destruction of the initial dust mass. While the total dust destruction varies widely across grain species and simulation parameters, our most extreme cases result in complete destruction for some grain species and only 44\% dust mass survival for the most robust species. These survival rates are important in understanding how early supernovae contribute to the observed dust masses in high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {The temperature and ionization of SN 1987A is modeled between 200 and 2000 days in its nebular phase, using a time-dependent model. We include all important elements, as well as the primary composition zones in the supernova. The energy input is provided by radioactive decay of Co-56, Co-57, and Ti-44. The thermalization of the resulting gamma-rays and positrons is calculated by solving the Spencer-Fano equation. Both the ionization and the individual level populations are calculated time-dependently. Adiabatic cooling is included in the energy equation. Charge transfer is important for determining the ionization and is included with available and estimated rates. Full, multilevel atoms are used for the observationally important ions. As input models to the calculations we use explosion models for SN 1987A calculated by Woosley et al and Nomoto et al. The most important result in this paper refers to the evolution of the temperature and ionization of the various abundance zones. The metal-rich core undergoes a thermal instability, often referred to as the IR-catastrophe, at 600 - 1000 days. The hydrogen-rich zones evolve adiabatically after 500 - 800 days, while in the helium region both adiabatic cooling and line cooling are of equal importance after \~{}1000 days. Freeze-out of the recombination is important in the hydrogen and helium zones. Concomitant with the IR-catastrophe, the bulk of the emission shifts from optical and near-IR lines to the mid- and far-IR. After the IR-catastrophe, the cooling is mainly due to far-IR lines and adiabatic expansion. Dust cooling is likely to be important in the zones where dust forms. We find that the dust condensation temperatures occur later than \~{}500 days in the oxygen-rich zones, and the most favorable zone for dust condensation is the iron core.},

abstract = {We have investigated the formation of dust in the ejecta of Type II supernovae (SNe), mostly of primordial composition, to answer the question of where are the first solid particles formed in the universe. However, we have also considered non-zero progenitor's metallicity values up to Z=Zsun. The calculations are based on standard nucleation theory and the scheme has been first tested on the well studied case of SN1987A, yielding results that are in agreement with the available data. We find that: i) the first dust grains are predominantly made of silicates, amorphous carbon (AC), magnetite, and corundum; ii) the largest grains are the AC ones, with sizes around 300 A, whereas other grain types have smaller radii, around 10-20 A. The grain size distribution depends somewhat on the thermodynamics of the ejecta expansion and variations in the results by a factor \~{} 2 might occur within reasonable estimates of the relevant parameters. Also, and for the same reason, the grain size distribution, is essentially unaffected by metallicity changes. The predictions on the amount of dust formed are very robust: for Z=0, we find that SNe with masses in the range (12-35) Msun produce about 0.08 Msun < M\_dust < 0.3 Msun of dust/SN. The above range increases by roughly 3 times as the metallicity is increased to solar values. We discuss the implications and the cosmological consequences of the results.},

abstract = {We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the Type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2004et, obtained with the \{$\backslash$it Spitzer Space Telescope\} between days 64 and 1406 past explosion. Late-time optical spectra are also presented. For the period 300-795 days past explosion, we argue that the spectral energy distribution of SN 2004et comprises (a) a hot component due to emission from optically thick gas, as well as free-bound radiation, (b) a warm component due to newly formed, radioactively heated dust in the ejecta, and (c) a cold component due to an IR echo from the interstellar-medium dust of the host galaxy, NGC 6946. There may also have been a small contribution to the IR SED due to free-free emission from ionised gas in the ejecta. We reveal the first-ever spectroscopic evidence for silicate dust formed in the ejecta of a supernova. This is supported by our detection of a large, but progressively declining, mass of SiO. However, we conclude that the mass of directly detected ejecta dust grew to no more than a few times 10\^{}(-4)Msun. We also provide evidence that the ejecta dust formed in comoving clumps of fixed size. We argue that, after about two years past explosion, the appearance of wide, box-shaped optical line profiles was due to the impact of the ejecta on the progenitor circumstellar medium and that the subsequent formation of a cool, dense shell was responsible for a later rise in the MIR flux. This study demonstrates the rich, multi-faceted ways in which a typical core-collapse supernova and its progenitor can produce and/or interact with dust grains. The work presented here adds to the growing number of studies which do not support the contention that SNe are responsible for the large mass of observed dust in high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {We present observations with VLT and HST of the broad emission lines from the inner ejecta and reverse shock of SN 1987A from 1999 until 2012 (days 4381 - 9100 after explosion). We detect broad lines from H-alpha, H-beta, Mg I], Na I, [O I], [Ca II] and a feature at 9220 A. We identify the latter line with Mg II 9218, 9244,most likely pumped by Ly-alpha fluorescence. H-alpha, and H-beta both have a centrally peaked component, extending to 4500 km/s and a very broad component extending to 11,000 km/s, while the other lines have only the central component. The low velocity component comes from unshocked ejecta, heated mainly by X-rays from the circumstellar ring collision, whereas the broad component comes from faster ejecta passing through the reverse shock. The reverse shock flux in H-alpha has increased by a factor of 4-6 from 2000 to 2007. After that there is a tendency of flattening of the light curve, similar to what may be seen in soft X-rays and in the optical lines from the shocked ring. The core component seen in H-alpha, [Ca II] and Mg II has experienced a similar increase, consistent with that found from HST photometry. The ring-like morphology of the ejecta is explained as a result of the X-ray illumination, depositing energy outside of the core of the ejecta. The energy deposition in the ejecta of the external X-rays illumination is calculated using explosion models for SN 1987A and we predict that the outer parts of the unshocked ejecta will continue to brighten because of this. We finally discuss evidence for dust in the ejecta from line asymmetries.},

abstract = {The light curves of 'hypernovae', i.e. very energetic supernovae with \$E\_\{51\} \backslash equiv E/10\^{}\{51\}\$ergs \$\backslash gsim 5-10\$ are characterized at epochs of a few months by a phase of linear decline. Classical, one-dimensional explosion models fail to simultaneously reproduce the light curve near peak and at the linear decline phase. The evolution of these light curves may however be explained by a simple model consisting of two concentric components. The outer component is responsible for the early part of the light curve and for the broad absorption features observed in the early spectra of hypernovae, similar to the one-dimensional models. In addition, a very dense inner component is added, which reproduces the linear decline phase in the observed magnitude-versus-time relation for SNe 1998bw, 1997ef, and 2002ap. This simple approach does contain one of the main features of jet-driven, asymmetric explosion models, namely the presence of a dense core. Although the total masses and energies derived with the two-component model are similar to those obtained in previous studies which also adopted spherical symmetry, this study suggests that the ejecta are aspherical, and thus the real energies and masses may deviate from those derived assuming spherical symmetry. The supernovae which were modeled are divided into two groups, according to the prominence of the inner component: the inner component of SN 1997ef is denser and more \$\^{}\{56\}\$Ni-rich, relative to the outer component, than the corresponding inner components of SNe 1998bw and 2002ap. These latter objects have a similar inner-to-outer component ratio, although they have very different global values of mass and energy.},

abstract = {The origin of dust in galaxies is still a mystery. The majority of the refractory elements are produced in supernova explosions, but it is unclear how and where dust grains condense and grow, and how they avoid destruction in the harsh environments of star-forming galaxies. The recent detection of 0.1 to 0.5 solar masses of dust in nearby supernova remnants suggests in situ dust formation, while other observations reveal very little dust in supernovae in the first few years after explosion. Observations of the spectral evolution of the bright SN 2010jl have been interpreted as pre-existing dust, dust formation or no dust at all. Here we report the rapid (40 to 240 days) formation of dust in its dense circumstellar medium. The wavelength-dependent extinction of this dust reveals the presence of very large (exceeding one micrometre) grains, which resist destruction. At later times (500 to 900 days), the near-infrared thermal emission shows an accelerated growth in dust mass, marking the transition of the dust source from the circumstellar medium to the ejecta. This provides the link between the early and late dust mass evolution in supernovae with dense circumstellar media.},

abstract = {Candidates for the modest galaxies that formed most of the stars in the early universe, at redshifts \$z > 7\$, have been found in large numbers with extremely deep restframe-UV imaging. But it has proved difficult for existing spectrographs to characterise them in the UV. The detailed properties of these galaxies could be measured from dust and cool gas emission at far-infrared wavelengths if the galaxies have become sufficiently enriched in dust and metals. So far, however, the most distant UV-selected galaxy detected in dust emission is only at \$z = 3.25\$, and recent results have cast doubt on whether dust and molecules can be found in typical galaxies at this early epoch. Here we report thermal dust emission from an archetypal early universe star-forming galaxy, A1689-zD1. We detect its stellar continuum in spectroscopy and determine its redshift to be \$z = 7.5\backslash pm0.2\$ from a spectroscopic detection of the Ly\{$\backslash$alpha\} break. A1689-zD1 is representative of the star-forming population during reionisation, with a total star-formation rate of about 12M\$\_\backslash odot\$ yr\$\^{}\{-1\}\$. The galaxy is highly evolved: it has a large stellar mass, and is heavily enriched in dust, with a dust-to-gas ratio close to that of the Milky Way. Dusty, evolved galaxies are thus present among the fainter star-forming population at \$z > 7\$, in spite of the very short time since they first appeared.},

abstract = {Using the temperature and ionization calculated in our previous paper, we model the spectral evolution of SN 1987A. The IR-catastrophe is seen in the metal lines as a transition from thermal to non-thermal excitation, most clearly in the [O I] 6300, 6364 lines. The distribution of the different zones, and therefore the gamma-ray deposition, is determined from the line profiles of the most important lines, where possible. We find the total mass of hydrogen-rich gas to be \~{}7.7 Msun. The helium mass derived from the line fluxes is sensitive to assumptions about the degree of redistribution in the line. The mass of the helium dominated zone is consistent with \~{}1.9 Msun, with a further \~{}3.9 Msun of helium residing in the hydrogen component. Because of uncertainties in the modeling of the non-thermal excitation of the [O I] lines, the uncertainty in the oxygen mass is considerable. In addition, masses of nitrogen, neon, magnesium, iron and nickel are estimated. The dominant contribution to the line luminosity often originates in a different zone from where most of the newly synthesized material resides. This applies to e.g. carbon, calcium and iron. The [C I] lines, mainly arising in the helium zone, indicate a substantially lower abundance of carbon mixed with helium than stellar evolution models give, and a more extended zone with CNO processed gas is indicated. The [Fe II] lines have in most phases a strong contribution from primordial iron, and at t > 600 - 800 days this component dominates the [Fe II] lines. The wings of the [Fe II] lines may therefore come from primordial iron, rather than synthesized iron mixed to high velocity. Lines from ions with low ionization potential indicate that the UV field below at least 1600 AA is severely quenched by dust absorption and resonance scattering.},

The observations reveal the presence of a population of cold dust grains radiating with a temperature of about 17 to 23 kelvin at a rate of about 220 times the luminosity of the Sun. The intensity and spectral energy distribution of the emission suggest a dust mass of about 0.4 to 0.7 times the mass of the Sun. The radiation must originate from the supernova ejecta and requires the efficient precipitation of all refractory material into dust. Our observations imply that supernovae can produce the large dust masses detected in young galaxies at very high redshifts.},

Even these pre-COSTAR observations avoid much of the contamination from the bright stars nearby and provide a very useful set of line strengths and shapes for analysis. The spectrum is formed in an unusual physical setting: cold gas which is excited and ionized by energetic electrons from the radioactive debris of the supernova explosion. The spectra of SN 1987A at this phase are surprisingly similar to those of the nova shells of CP Puppis and T Pyxidis decades after outburst. SN 1987A and the novae are characterized by emission from material with electron temperatures of only a few hundred degrees Kelvin, and show narrow Balmer continuum emission and strong emission lines from O\$\^{}+\$. The Balmer continuum shape requires the electron temperature in the supernova ejecta to be as low as 500 K on day 1862 and 400 K on day 2210 after outburst. The $\backslash$OIIUV$\backslash$ doublet is surprisingly strong and is plausibly powered by collisional ionization of neutral oxygen to excited states of O\$\^{}+\$. The line intensity ratio of the $\backslash$OID$\backslash$ doublet obtained from Gaussian fits of the line profiles is 1.8\$\backslash pm0.2\$, contrary to the optically thin limit of 3. This ratio is \{$\backslash$it not\} due to an optical depth effect, but rather is an artifact of assuming a Gaussian profile to fit the $\backslash$OID$\backslash$ doublet profile. Specifying the line ratio \$R\backslash, = \backslash, F([\{\backslash rm OI\}]6300)/F([\{\backslash rm OI\}]6364)\$ = 3 is consistent with the data and allows a calculation of the decomposed line profile. All the observed strong lines are found to be blueshifted by a similar amount},

abstract = {In this paper, two series of Mg-Fe silicate glasses prepared as laboratory analogues of interstellar and/or circumstellar silicate dust are presented: glasses with pyroxene stoichiometry following the formula Mg(x)Fe(1-x)SiO\_3\_ with x=0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.95, and 1.0 and glasses with olivine stoichiometry according to the formula Mg(2y)Fe(2-2y)SiO\_4\_ with y=0.4 and 0.5. Preparation and analytical characterization followed the lines described in Paper I (Jaeger et al. 1994). From the reflectance and ellipsometric measurements on polished surfaces of the samples which were supplemented by transmittance measurements of thin slabs in sufficiently transparent spectral regions, consistent sets of optical constants in the wavelength range from 190 nm to 500$\mu$m have been derived. The seven sets of optical data of pyroxene glasses represent a unique data base that permitted to study correlations between diagnostic spectral parameters in the range of the vibrational bands (peak positions, band widths, band strengths' ratio, depth of the trough between the bands) and the iron content in great detail. The olivine data followed the same trends found in the pyroxene data. For the first time, the influence of the iron content on the UV/VIS/NIR absorption of silicate dust analogues could be demonstrated quantitatively in an experimental way. With the new data, the astrophysical discussion started in Paper I was continued and focussed on the comparison of the olivine glass data with IRAS LRS spectra of O-rich circumstellar envelopes around Mira stars. The generally accepted fact that amorphous silicates with olivine stoichiometry can reproduce the observed bands of evolved stars was confirmed by the new data on the whole. However, in the range of the trough between the bands, the new laboratory analogues are apparently too clean in order to yield sufficiently large absorption coefficients. Possibilities to remove this discrepancy are discussed. The new olivine glasses point to the interesting consequence that the temperature for silicate dust grains at the inner edge of circumstellar envelopes must be considerably higher than the values often given in the literature. Thus, the new data would reduce the well-known discrepancy between the low dust temperatures formerly derived from the observations and the much higher condensation temperatures computed by theorists studying the dust formation process in the envelopes.},

Aims.The new Hipparcos astrometric catalogue is checked for the quality of the data and the consistency of the formal errors as well as the possible presence of error correlations. The differences with the earlier publication are explained. Methods. The internal errors are followed through the reduction process, and the external errors are investigated on the basis of a comparison with radio observations of a small selection of stars, and the distribution of negative parallaxes. Error correlation levels are investigated and the reduction by more than a factor 10 as obtained in the new catalogue is explained. Results.The formal errors on the parallaxes for the new catalogue are confirmed. The presence of a small amount of additional noise, though unlikely, cannot be ruled out. Conclusions. The new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data provides an improvement by a factor 2.2 in the total weight compared to the catalogue published in 1997, and provides much improved data for a wide range of studies on stellar luminosities and local galactic kinematics.},

The influence of inhomogeneities on the derived mass-loss rates is then examined to develop ideas related to W-R stellar winds and stellar evolution. Existing evidence regarding electron-scattering wings in W-R stellar spectra is reviewed, and present models are found to be inadequate to describe the weak wings. Theoretical line profiles are computed by two separate methods, and the effect of an inhomogeneous density structure on the strength of the electron-scattering wings is examined. The line profiles and line strengths are similar to observed values except that the mean mass-loss rate is lower; the corresponding reduction in the strength of the wings shows that the mass-loss rates for W-R stars are overestimated.},

The last decade of evolution has exhibited a strengthening of the oxygen transitions, evidence that the late-time emission is powered by increasingly metal-rich SN ejecta crossing the reverse shock. The H-alpha luminosity requires that SN 1998S is still interacting with dense circumstellar material (CSM), probably produced by the strong wind of a red supergiant progenitor at least \~{}1000 years before explosion. The emission lines exhibit asymmetric blueshifted profiles, which implies that the receding hemisphere of the SN is obscured by dust. The [O III] line, in particular, exhibits a complete suppression of its red wing. This could be the result of the expected wavelength dependence for dust extinction or a smaller radial distribution for [O III]. In the latter case, the red wing of [O III] could be absorbed by core dust, while both the blue and red wings are absorbed by dust within the cool dense shell between the forward and reverse shocks; this interpretation could explain why late-time [O III] emission from SNe is often weaker than models predict. The [O I] line exhibits double-peaked structure on top of the broader underlying profile, possibly due to emission from individual clumps of ejecta or ring-like structures of metal-rich debris. The centroids of the peaks are blueshifted and lack a red counterpart. However, an archival spectrum obtained on day 1093 exhibits a third, redshifted peak, which we suspect has become extinguished by dust that formed over the last decade. This implies that the "missing" red components of multi-peaked oxygen profiles observed in other SNe might be obscured by varying degrees of dust extinction.},

abstract = {We present a new, detailed analysis of late-time mid-infrared (IR) observations of the Type II-P supernova (SN) 2003gd. At about 16 months after the explosion, the mid-IR flux is consistent with emission from 4 x 10\^{}(-5) M(solar) of newly condensed dust in the ejecta. At 22 months emission from point-like sources close to the SN position was detected at 8 microns and 24 microns. By 42 months the 24 micron flux had faded. Considerations of luminosity and source size rule out the ejecta of SN 2003gd as the main origin of the emission at 22 months. A possible alternative explanation for the emission at this later epoch is an IR echo from pre-existing circumstellar or interstellar dust. We conclude that, contrary to the claim of Sugerman et al. (2006, \sci, 313, 196), the mid-IR emission from SN 2003gd does not support the presence of 0.02 M(solar) of newly formed dust in the ejecta. There is, as yet, no direct evidence that core-collapse supernovae are major dust factories.},

abstract = {Dusty hyperluminous galaxies in the early universe provide unique environments for studying the role of massive stars in the formation and destruction of dust. At redshifts above \~{} 6, when the universe was less than \~{} 1 Gyr old, dust could have only condensed in the explosive ejecta of Type II supernovae (SNe), since most of the progenitors of the AGB stars, the major alternative source of interstellar dust, did not have time to evolve off the main sequence since the onset of star formation. In this paper we present analytical models for the evolution of the gas, dust, and metals in high redshift galaxies, with a special application to SDSS J1148+5251, a hyperluminous quasar at z = 6.4. We find that an average supernova must condense at least 1 Msun of dust to account for the observed dust mass in this quasar. Observationally, it is in excess of the largest dust yield of \~{}0.02 Msun found thus far in the ejecta of any SN. If future observations find this to be a typical supernova dust yield, then additional processes, such as accretion onto preexisting grains, or condensation around the AGN will need to be invoked to account for the large amount of dust in this and similar objects. The galaxy's star formation history is still uncertain, and current observations of the gas, metal, and dust contents of J1148 can be reproduced by either an intensive and short burst of star formation (\~{} 1000 Msun/yr) with a duration of \~{} 100 Myr, or a much lower star formation rate (\~{} 100 Msun/yr) occurring over the lifetime of the galaxy.},

abstract = {We report observations of three SDSS z>6 QSOs at 250 GHz (1.2mm) using the 117-channel Max-Planck Millimeter Bolometer (MAMBO-2) array at the IRAM 30-meter telescope. J1148+5251 (z=6.41) and J1048+4637 (z=6.23) were detected with 250 GHz flux densities of 5.0 +- 0.6 mJy and 3.0 +- 0.4 mJy, respectively. J1630+4012 (z=6.05) was not detected with a 3 sigma upper limit of 1.8 mJy. Upper flux density limits from VLA observations at 43 GHz for J1148+5251 and J1048+4637 imply steeply rising spectra, indicative of thermal infrared emission from warm dust. The far-infrared luminosities are estimated to be $\backslash$\~{}10\^{}13 L\_sun, and the dust masses \~{}10\^{}8 M\_sun, assuming Galactic dust properties. The presence of large amounts of dust in the highest redshift QSOs indicates that dust formation must be rapid during the early evolution of QSO host galaxies. Dust absorption may hinder the escape of ionizing photons which reionize the intergalactic medium at this early epoch.},

@article{Hammer2010,
abstract = {We present the first three-dimensional (3D) simulations of the large-scale mixing that takes place in the shock-heated stellar layers ejected in the explosion of a 15.5 solar-mass blue supergiant star. The outgoing supernova shock is followed from its launch by neutrino heating until it breaks out from the stellar surface more than two hours after the core collapse. Violent convective overturn in the post-shock layer causes the explosion to start with significant asphericity, which triggers the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities at the composition interfaces of the exploding star. Deep inward mixing of hydrogen (H) is found as well as fast-moving, metal-rich clumps penetrating with high velocities far into the H-envelope of the star as observed, e.g., in the case of SN 1987A. Also individual clumps containing a sizeable fraction of the ejected iron-group elements (up to several 0.001 solar masses) are obtained in some models. The metal core of the progenitor is partially turned over with Ni-dominated fingers overtaking oxygen-rich bullets and both Ni and O moving well ahead of the material from the carbon layer. Comparing with corresponding 2D (axially symmetric) calculations, we determine the growth of the RT fingers to be faster, the deceleration of the dense metal-carrying clumps in the He and H layers to be reduced, the asymptotic clump velocities in the H-shell to be higher (up to \~{}4500 km/s for the considered progenitor and an explosion energy of 10\^{}\{51\} ergs, instead of <2000 km/s in 2D), and the outward radial mixing of heavy elements and inward mixing of hydrogen to be more efficient in 3D than in 2D. We present a simple argument that explains these results as a consequence of the different action of drag forces on moving objects in the two geometries. (abridged)},

@article{Silvia2010,
abstract = {We investigate through hydrodynamic simulations the destruction of newly-formed dust grains by sputtering in the reverse shocks of supernova remnants. Using an idealized setup of a planar shock impacting a dense, spherical clump, we implant a population of Lagrangian particles into the clump to represent a distribution of dust grains in size and composition. We then post-process the simulation output to calculate the grain sputtering for a variety of species and size distributions. We explore the parameter space appropriate for this problem by altering the over-density of the ejecta clumps and the speed of the reverse shocks. Since radiative cooling could lower the temperature of the medium in which the dust is embedded and potentially protect the dust by slowing or halting grain sputtering, we study the effects of different cooling methods over the time scale of the simulations. In general, our results indicate that grains with radii less than 0.1 microns are sputtered to much smaller radii and often destroyed completely, while larger grains survive their interaction with the reverse shock. We also find that, for high ejecta densities, the percentage of dust that survives is strongly dependent on the relative velocity between the clump and the reverse shock, causing up to 50\% more destruction for the highest velocity shocks. The fraction of dust destroyed varies widely across grain species, ranging from total destruction of Al2O3 grains to minimal destruction of Fe grains (only 20\% destruction in the most extreme cases). C and SiO2 grains show moderate to strong sputtering as well, with 38\% and 80\% mass loss. The survival rate of grains formed by early supernovae is crucial in determining whether or not they can act as the "dust factories" needed to explain high-redshift dust.},
