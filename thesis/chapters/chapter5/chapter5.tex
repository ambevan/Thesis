On 23 February 1987, a star died in an explosion that would inform our understanding of core-collapse supernovae for decades to come.  SN~1987A is uniquely important to the study of supernovae.  At only 50 kpc away in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and as the brightest supernova to be observed since SN 1604 (Kepler), it has provided an unprecedented opportunity for studying every aspect of supernovae.  Since its discovery by Ian Shelton and Oscar Duhalde at Las Campanas, Chile \citep{Kunkel1987}, SN~1987A has been continuously observed across the entire wavelength range, providing astronomers with a wealth of data and discoveries.  

SN~1987A was the first supernova to be detected via the emission of neutrinos.  Hours before the visible light from SN~1987A reached Earth, 19 neutrinos were simultaneously detected in various locations across the globe confirming the core-collapse theory of supernovae \citep{Bionta1987,Hirata1987}.  However, the neutron star that is expected to have resulted from this collapse has yet to be detected.  Various theories exist for this non-detection such as the possibility that a black hole formed instead of a neutron star or that dust is obscuring our view \citep{Brown1992}.

The detection of neutrinos in combination with the presence of hydrogen lines in the early spectra resulted in the classification of SN~1987A as a Type II supernova.  However, SN~1987A was unusually dim at peak magnitude compared to other Type II SNe and brightened very quickly, its magnitude increasing by a factor of 100 in just three hours compared to a normal timeframe of several days.  SN~1987A exhibited a number of other somewhat unusual features. Broad lines detected in the very early spectra indicated expansion velocities of up to 30,000~km~s$^{-1}$, much faster than the typical 15,000~km~s$^{-1}$. The colour evolution of the object was also faster than  expected.  These atypical properties suggested that the progenitor star was more compact than the red supergiants that are believed to normally give rise to Type II SNe.  In fact, four days after the initial detection of SN~1987A, the progenitor star was identified as having been the blue supergiant Sanduleak -69$^{\circ}$ 202  confirming this theory \citep{Sonneborn1987}.  These distinctive features, in combination with a plateauing light curve, led to the final classification of SN~1987A as a peculiar Type II-P supernova.

After the initial flash of ionising radiation in the first few hours \citep{Ensman1992}, the expanding debris of SN~1987A cooled rapidly, dropping from 14,000 K to 6,000 K between the first and tenth days after outburst \citep{Kirshner1987} before eventually stabilising at around 5,500 K.  By just four months after outburst, the debris were transparent in the optical and IR \citep{McCray1993}.  The ejecta spectrum was dominated by emission lines, often exhibiting P-Cygni profiles, arising from a blackbody-like continuum.  Numerous hydrogen, calcium and sodium lines could be seen in the optical as well as a rich spectrum of IR emission lines  from other heavy elements.  

The forward shock continued to propagate through the ejecta and by the mid 1990s reached the innermost of the beautiful and complex system of rings that are observed around SN~1987A (see Figures \ref{87A_img} and \ref{HST_ring}).  The rings were most likely caused by an ejection of mass following a binary merger some 20,000 years before SN~1987A exploded \citep{Morris2005,Fitzpatrick2013}.  This merger also likely explains the surprising blue colour of the progenitor star.  A series of images of the equatorial ring (ER) taken using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)  clearly show the appearance of ``hot spots" as the dense material is shock-ionised on impact with the forward shock (see Figure \ref{HST_ring}).  The interaction of the forward shock with the ER has precipitated a strong reverse shock that is now travelling back through the ejected material \citep{Fransson2013}.  The illumination of the outer parts of the ejecta by the reverse shock is visible in spectra taken at later epochs as faster regions became more dominant in line profiles making them appear broader.  It has been suggested that this point in SN~1987A's evolution marks its transition to a remnant \citep{McCray2003}.

The ionisation and heating of the ejecta of the supernova is caused by gamma rays that result from the decay of $^{56}$Co, $^{57}$Co and $^{44}$Ti (with half lives of 77.3 days, 272 days and 59 years respectively \citep{Manuel2002}).  The gamma rays Compton scatter off electrons that are often bound causing the production of fast, primary photoelectrons. These primary electrons go on to impact atoms causing further ionisations and excitations. A population of secondary electrons is thus produced.  Recombinations and de-excitations result in the emission of monochromatic photons.  These emission lines are then broadened thermally and via the large bulk velocity of the emitting medium.  I present models of these optical and IR emission line profiles from SN~1987A throughout this chapter.  The ionisation state of the ejecta of SN~1987A is thought to reach a period of stability known as the ``freeze-out" when a balance is reached between the recombination and ionisation rates \citep{Danziger1991,Kozma1998a,Fransson2013}.  This is discussed in further detail later in this chapter as it has relevance to the evolution of the shapes of the line profiles.

A full review of SN~1987A in all its glory would likely extend to many dozen of pages and so in the following paragraphs I will focus only on those facets of the history of SN~1987A that relate to the formation of dust in its ejecta.  For extensive reviews covering the progenitor, the explosion mechanism, the dynamics and geometry, the light curves and spectral evolution, the thermodynamics, the chemistry and the circumstellar ring system I refer the reader to the reviews by \citet{Arnett1989}, \citet{McCray1993} and \citet{McCray2003}.  A comprehensive review of SN~1987A by Richard McCray encompassing its later evolution is due to be published next year \citep{McCray2016}.

\section{10,000 Days of Dust}
SN~1987A is the first and only supernova to have had the formation of dust in its ejecta traced via all three observable signatures described in Section \ref{three_sigs} \citep{Bouchet2014}.  Before dust was observed, its formation in the ejecta of SN 1987A was predicted.  \citet{Gehrz1987} recognised that conditions in the cooling ejecta would eventually reach temperatures and densities appropriate for dust formation to occur.  They predicted that the onset of dust formation would occur at around days 240-300.  This idea was expanded upon by \citet{Dwek1988} who estimated that dust would begin to form slightly later at around day 400 and might even cause an optical black-out of the supernova.

The first indications of dust in the ejecta of SN~1987A appeared at around day 350 with the emergence of continuum radiation in the IR longward of 5~$\mu$m \citep{Meikle1993}.  This had become prominent by day 550 \citep{Roche1993,Wooden1993}.  It was suggested by some that this excess IR emission was the result of  a light echo reflecting off the circumstellar material \citep{Roche1989}.  However, at around day 530, the optical luminosity suddenly started dropping more rapidly than it had done previously.  The IR luminosity started to increase,  compensating for the drop in the optical and ensuring that the bolometric light curve continued to follow the same trajectory \citep{Suntzeff1991,Whitelock1991}.  At the same time it was observed that the peaks of several emission lines in the optical and IR had become shifted towards the blue indicating that the dust was indeed within the supernova envelope itself \citep{Lucy1989,Danziger1991a,Danziger1991,Meikle1991,Meikle1993,Suntzeff1991,Hanuschik1993}.  It was Leon Lucy and collaborators who first suggested that the presence of blue-shifted line profiles may indicate dust formation in the ejecta of supernovae and they even went as far as producing some models to illustrate the effects.  They used this method  to estimate for the first time the dust mass in the ejecta of SN~1987A ($10^{-6}M_{\odot} - 10^{-4}M_{\odot}$,  \citealt{Lucy1989,Lucy1991}).  Around this time, \citet{Wooden1993} also placed a lower limit of $\sim10^{-4}$~M$_{\odot}$ on the  dust mass in SN~1987A based on SED-fitting.

After this intensive monitoring of SN~1987A in the MIR, there was something of a gap in observations.  By the mid 1990s SN~1987A had faded and could no longer be detected in the mid-IR with current instruments.  It was not until 2004 that new instruments at the Gemini South telescope and at the Very Large Telescope allowed for the resumption of observations of SN~1987A at these wavelengths.  The first resolved detection of the central ejecta was reported by \citet{Bouchet2004} who observed the object at 10~$\mu$m and  $20$~$\mu$m. They estimated a  mass  of $10^{-4}M_{\odot}-2 \times 10^{-3}M_{\odot}$ for the dust in the ejecta, with an estimated temperature of $90K<T<100K$.  They concluded that CCSNe could potentially be a significant source of dust in the Universe but could not solely account for the masses seen at high redshifts (see Chapter \ref{chp:chp1}).  Subsequent observations continued to detect this faint mid-IR emission right up to the present day \citep{Dwek2010,Bouchet2014} whilst radiative transfer models of the SEDs continued to find dust masses of the order of $10^{-4}-10^{-3}M_{\odot}$ during the first 1000 days \citep{Ercolano2007}.

For many years it was assumed that only a small mass of dust, possibly as much as a few $\times 10^{-3}M_{\odot}$, had formed in the ejecta of SN~1987A within the first 1000 days.  It was not until the first \textit{Herschel} observations of SN~1987A that the picture suddenly changed.  SN~1987A had not been chosen as a target for the \textit{Herschel} mission as it was believed that it would not be detectable at far-IR and sub-mm wavelengths.  However, in 2010, whilst \textit{Herschel} was performing a survey of the LMC as a part of the HERITAGE survey \citep{Meixner2013}, an unexpectedly strong signal was detected in the same region as SN~1987A.  In 2011, \citet{Matsuura2011} published the first detections of the SN~1987A system at long wavelengths (100, 160, 250 and 350~$\mu$m presented in Figure \ref{Herschel_img}).  These observations revealed the presence of a massive reservoir (0.4 - 0.7 $M_{\odot}$) of cold dust ($17K<T<23K$) that they argued was located in the ejecta.  \textit{Herschel} did not have the angular resolution to determine the location of the emitting dust and as a result there was much contention over this assertion with many claiming that the detection was of pre-existing dust located in the circumstellar material \citep{Bouchet2014}.  However, follow-up observations of SN~1987A with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) published by \citet{Indebetouw2014} resolved the SN-ring system and revealed the location of the dust to be entirely within the ejecta (see Figure \ref{ALMA}).  Further pointed\textit{Herschel} observations corroborated the large estimated dust masses \citep{Matsuura2015}.  These dust mass estimates were all based on fitting dust spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that peaked at far-IR wavelengths.

The majority of the dust in the ejecta of SN~1987A is located centrally and as such has not yet encountered the reverse shock that is propagating back towards it.  Whilst it is now clear that very large masses of dust have indeed formed in the ejecta of SN~1987A, it remains unclear whether the dust will survive the passage of the reverse shock.  The composition of the dust and the size of the grains are crucial to understanding how much of the dust that has formed will actually be deposited into the ISM in the future.  Further observations and analyses of the dust mass present in the ejecta are  crucial to understanding how much dust is actually contributed to the ISM from CCSNe.




The {\em Herschel} mission ended in 2013 and there is now likely to be a long wait for far-IR facilities with comparable or better sensitivities than {\em Herschel} to become available.  The method of SED fitting is therefore unhelpful until other telescopes come into operation.  This provides a strong incentive to make use of alternative methods to estimate the dust masses that form in supernova ejecta.  Following the work of \citet{Lucy1989}, no further analysis of the shapes of the line profiles in SN~1987A has been performed.  With such a large database of spectral observations available, SN~1987A provides the perfect opportunity to assess the evolution of the formation of dust in the ejecta of CCSNe.

In this chapter, I present a number of models of line profiles of SN~1987A. I have collated optical spectra from the archives of four different telescopes in order to study the effects of dust formation on 
the H$\alpha$ line and on the [O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ doublet.  
I have modelled epochs spanning a range of approximately 8 years, from the first 
indications of blue-shifting in the H$\alpha$ line between days 600-700, using 
both smooth and clumped geometries.  I compare my derived dust masses to 
those obtained by (\citealt{Wesson2015}, hereafter W15) and (\citealt{Dwek2015}, hereafter DA15) and consider the implied dust formation rate. 

In Section \ref{spectra}, I detail the observed spectra that I used for 
my modelling and I present my modelling of the 
H$\alpha$ and [O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ lines in 
Section \ref{results}.  Finally, I discuss my findings in Section 
\ref{discuss}.

\section{Spectral Observations of SN~1987A}
\label{spectra}
%This is just the archival spectra section of the paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   SPECTRA   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SN~1987A has been the most intensively observed supernova in history, with 
an abundance of both spectral and photometric data available to model.  From 
the archives of a number of different telescopes I have collated optical 
spectra acquired over a wide range of epochs.  At the earlier epochs I 
use spectra obtained by the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) and the Cerro 
Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) and at later epochs I 
use spectra from the archives of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Very 
Large Telescope (VLT).  An explosion date of 23 February 1987 is adopted 
throughout and epochs are measured relative to this date.  Full details of 
all observations may be found in Table \ref{tb:data}. The spectral 
resolutions of the grating spectrograph observations are listed in 
column~7, while column~8 lists the spectral resolving powers of the 
echelle spectrograph observations.


Wavelength ranges encompassing the H$\alpha$ line and [O~{\sc 
i}]~$\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ doublet were selected in order to trace their 
evolution from day 524, near the time of the first indications of dust 
formation \citep{Wooden1993}, to day 8020, near the current era. Optical 
spectroscopy obtained at the AAT using the Faint Object Red Spectrograph 
(FORS) during the first two years after outburst was kindly supplied by Dr 
Raylee Stathakis \citep{Spyromilio1991, Hanuschik1993, Spyromilio1993} and 
optical spectra from the CTIO were donated by Dr Mark Phillips 
\citep{Suntzeff1991}.

The evolution of the H$\alpha$ and [O~{\sc i}] line profiles is presented 
in Figures \ref{Ha_evol_early} and \ref{Ha_evol_late}.  At later epochs, 
the broad H$\alpha$ profile emitted by the ejecta becomes contaminated by 
narrow line emission from the ER.  These lines have been 
removed for the purposes of modelling the broad line. A continuum fit has 
been subtracted from each spectrum and a velocity correction has been 
applied for a recession velocity of 287 km~s$^{-1}$ 
\citep{Groningsson2008}.




\subsection{Contamination of the H$\alpha$ Profiles}

The H$\alpha$ profile at day 714 exhibits a very slight inflection visible 
at $V \approx +900$ km~s$^{-1}$.  By day 806, this slight inflection has 
developed into a noticeable shoulder in the line profile of H$\alpha$ (see 
Figure \ref{Ha}).




Although these features are similar in nature to features produced by dust 
absorption in the flat-topped region (as discussed in Section \ref{beta}), 
I conclude that this shoulder is an early appearance of the unresolved 
[N~{\sc ii}] $\lambda$6583~\AA\ line from the ER \citep{Kozma1998b}.  Unresolved nebular [N~{\sc ii}] lines at $\lambda=$ 6583~\AA\ and 
$\lambda=$ 6548~\AA\ either side of the H$\alpha$ rest frame velocity at 
6563~\AA\ are certainly seen by day 1054 
%(see Figure \ref{d1054}) 
and have to be removed in order to consider the evolution of the broad 
H$\alpha$ profile (see Figure \ref{Ha_evol_early}). I do not remove this 
potential contaminant at earlier epochs but try to fit the broad line 
profiles around it.

 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[clip=true,scale=0.6,trim= 0 0 0 0]{chapters/chapter5/images/d1054Ha}
\caption{The low resolution H$\alpha$ line profile from SN~1987A observed at the CTIO on day 1054.  The unresolved narrow nebular [N~{\sc ii}] lines at $\lambda=$ 6583~\AA\ and $\lambda=$ 6548~\AA\ and the narrow nebular H$\alpha$ line at $\lambda=$6563~\AA\  can be clearly seen.}
\label{d1054_Ha}
\end{figure}
 
By day 1054, all three of the narrow nebular lines (H$\alpha$ and N[{\sc ii}]) are strong.  They 
remain unresolved in the low spectral resolution CTIO data at days 1054 
and 1478 and therefore contaminate the entire central region of the 
H$\alpha$ line profile (see Figure \ref{d1054_Ha}).  Their presence renders two CTIO H$\alpha$ 
profiles from days 1054 and 1478 unusable for modelling purposes.  The HST 
and VLT H$\alpha$ profiles at later epochs ($\ge$ 1862 days) have a higher 
spectral resolution and it was therefore easier to remove the narrower 
[N~{\sc ii}] and H$\alpha$ lines from the broad H$\alpha$ profiles (for 
example Figures \ref{Ha_evol_early} and \ref{Ha_evol_late}). Although this 
does remove a potentially informative section of the profile ($+500$ 
km~s$^{-1}<v<+1500$ km~s$^{-1}$), I achieve good fits to the overall line 
profiles at these epochs.

\subsection{The Evolution of the Maximum and Minimum Velocities}

For a freely expanding medium, the velocity of any fractional radial 
element should not change with time.  The maximum velocity of any 
line-emitting region is therefore expected to be constant.  However, at 
the epochs I consider here, it appears that the maximum velocities of the 
H$\alpha$ line, as determined by the velocity at zero intensity on the 
blue side, generally increase over time (see Table \ref{FWHM}).  I 
attribute this to the start of the freeze-out phase in the outer regions 
of the ejecta, while the hydrogen neutral fraction is still increasing in 
the denser inner regions \citep{Danziger1991,Fransson1993}.

The onset of a fixed ionisation structure in the ejecta causes the rate of 
H$\alpha$ flux decline to slow.  Since the outer, faster moving regions 
reach this state at earlier times than the inner, slower moving regions, 
the relative flux contribution of the outer regions is increased.  At 
early epochs ($t<900$ days) the flux contribution from hydrogen in the 
core dominates the overall H$\alpha$ flux, whereas at later epochs ($t > 
900$ days) the flux from the envelope dominates \citep{Fransson1993, 
Kozma1998a}.  This shift likely explains apparent broadening of the line 
with the higher velocity material becoming increasingly noticeable in the 
line profiles.  This may also explain the increase in half-width zero intensity (HWZI) velocities at 
these epochs with the relative flux from the very densest regions dropping 
more rapidly relative to the outer line-emitting region. The full-width 
half maximum (FWHM) remains relatively steady (see Table 
\ref{FWHM}). However, the FWHM values presented in Table \ref{FWHM} were difficult 
to determine accurately since the peak of the broad line profile is

\section{Modelling SN~1987A}
\label{results}





I have modelled the H$\alpha$ line of SN~1987A at days 714, 806, 1862, 
2211, 2875, 3500 and 3604, and the [O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ 
doublet at days 714, 806, 1054 and 1478.  After day 3604 the H$\alpha$ 
profile begins to become dominated by emission from the reverse shock and 
the structure of the emitting region may no longer be approximated by a 
single shell model as I do here \citep{Fransson2013}.  The [O~{\sc 
i}]~$\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ doublet becomes too weak to model after day 
1478 (see Figure \ref{Ha_evol_early}).  I continue to adopt a velocity 
profile $V(r) = \frac{V_{max}}{R_{max}}r$ and treat the variable 
parameters listed at the start of Section \ref{param_sens_analysis}.  Whilst the albedo and 
optical depth are not varied directly, they are altered by adjusting the 
dust mass, $M_{dust}$, and the grain radius, $a$, which together determine 
the albedo and optical depth via Mie theory and the optical properties of 
the dust.

In all models, the ejecta occupies a shell with inner radius $R_{in}$ and 
outer radius $R_{out}$.  Packets are emitted according to a smooth density 
profile assuming recombination or collisional excitation such that $i(r) 
\propto \rho(r)^2 \propto r^{-2\beta}$.  Initially the dust is considered 
to have a smooth density distribution and is assumed to be coupled to the 
gas so as to follow the same radial profile.  A clumped distribution of 
dust is considered later (see Section \ref{clumped_models}).

Assuming an electron temperature of 10,000~K, I estimated the total electron scattering optical depths between $R_{in}$ and $R_{out}$ based on the 
observed fluxes of the H$\alpha$ recombination line. A temperature of 10,000~K for the recombining material is 
likely too high at the epochs considered but I adopt it in order
not to underestimate electron scattering optical depths.  The values 
I calculate from the observed H$\alpha$ luminosities are listed in Table 
\ref{tau_e}.  Since the electron scattering optical depths at these epochs 
are negligibly small I therefore do not include electron scattering in 
the models.




There is rarely a unique set of parameters that provide the best fit to 
the data.  However, the majority of the parameters of interest can be well 
constrained from my modelling by considering different elements of the 
shape of the profile.  In particular, by constructing fits to the data 
using minimum and maximum limits for the grain radius, credible lower and 
upper bounds on the dust mass formed within the ejecta may be derived.  
I present here fits to the data obtained using both small and large 
values of the grain radius $a$ since it is the grain radius which has the 
most significant effect on the overall dust mass required to reproduce the 
line profile (see Section \ref{param_sens_analysis}).


All of my models are of a dusty medium composed solely of amorphous 
carbon grains. I use the optical constants from the BE sample presented 
by \citet{Zubko1996}.  Although previous SED modelling of SN~1987A  
limited the fraction of silicates present in the dusty ejecta to a maximum 
of 15\% (\citealt{Ercolano2007}, W15), the recent work of \citet{Dwek2015} has suggested that a large mass of mostly silicate dust may have formed at early epochs ($\sim$ 615 days).  It is therefore useful to consider the effects 
on my models of using silicate dust.  I discuss this in detail in 
Sections \ref{species} and \ref{dwek}.



For each profile, the maximum velocity is initially identified from the 
data as the point where the emission vanishes on the blue side and is then 
varied throughout the modelling in order to produce the best fit.  The 
equivalent point on the red side is indeterminate from observations due to 
the effects of dust scattering.  I determine the approximate value of 
$V_{min}$ by examining the width of the profile near its peak. Using the features and shapes presented in Figures \ref{bt} and \ref{wt} as a guide, I first examined the observed profile for any obvious points of inflection or abrupt changes in the steepness of the profile.  If these were observed then they were compared to similar changes in theoretical profiles which allowed me to estimate the value of $V_{min}$.  If none were observed, then a model setting $V_{min}$ to be the velocity of the profile peak was considered.  Where neither of these approaches yielded a good model (this was rare) I iterated over a range of values of $V_{min}$ as with other variable parameters such as the dust mass.  On the red side the theoretical minimum velocity often 
falls at a similar velocity to the narrow nebular [N~{\sc ii}] 6583~\AA\ line so any dust-induced 
features near this wavelength that would allow a more accurate 
determination of $V_{min}$ can be overwhelmed by the nebular line.  
Having determined the minimum and maximum velocities, the ratio of the 
inner and outer radii of the supernova ejecta can be determined since 
$R_{in}/R_{out}=V_{min}/V_{max}$.  The outer radius is calculated from the 
epoch and the maximum velocity.

grain radii.  Model parameters are the same as the smooth dust fit for 
day 714 (Table \ref{smooth1}) except for the 
grain radius distribution and dust mass:  $M_{dust}=8.0 \times 10^{-6} 
M_{\odot}$, $a_{min}=0.005~\mu$m, $a_{max}=0.25~\mu$m and $n(a) \propto 
a^{-3.5}$.}
\label{MRN}

\end{figure}

The only parameters that  remain to be determined are the exponent of 
the density profile $\beta$, the mean grain radius and the total dust 
mass.  The shape of the blue wing is solely a product of the density 
profile and the dust mass; the height and shape of the red wing is a 
product of these and also of the scattering efficiency of the grains (the 
albedo $\omega$); the extent and shape of the asymmetry in the flat-topped 
portion of the profile is a function of only the total dust optical depth 
determined by the dust mass and the grain radius.  By iterating over these 
three parameters, an excellent fit to the data can usually be 
obtained.

Models are produced in the same manner for the [O~{\sc 
i}]~$\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ doublet as for the single H$\alpha$ line, with 
each component of the doublet being modelled independently and the 
resulting profiles added according to a specified ratio.  Although the 
theoretical intrinsic flux ratio is 3.1 for optically thin emission \citep{Storey2000}, the 
actual ratio between the two components can be affected by self-absorption 
\citep{Li1992} and I therefore left it as a free parameter.  The deduced 
doublet ratios are listed in Tables \ref{smooth1}, \ref{clumped1} and 
\ref{clumped2}.

For all lines, though particularly at very late epochs, even small 
fluctuations in the adopted value of the continuum level can have a 
substantial effect on the fit to the resulting profile.  Since it is not 
feasible to establish the level of the continuum so precisely, the value 
of the continuum has been left as a free parameter that may be adjusted 
(to within sensible margins) in order to allow for the widest possible 
dust mass range to be determined.  I generally find it is necessary to 
assume a continuum level that is slightly lower where the dust mass is 
higher.  The [O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ doublets at days 1054 and 
1478 are weak relative to the continuum and are also blended with the 
wings of other lines making it difficult to fit their wings accurately.  
I aim to fit the lines between approximately -3000 km s$^{-1}$ and +5000 
km s$^{-1}$ but present a wider velocity range for context (for example 
see Figure \ref{OI_smooth}).


All profiles have been smoothed to approximately the same resolution as 
the observed profiles using a moving-average procedure.  Parameters for 
the models at all epochs are detailed in 
Tables \ref{smooth1} to \ref{clumped2}.

\end{figure}


Even at the earliest epochs there is a substantial wing on the red side of 
the H$\alpha$ line profile that cannot be fitted by scattering from moving 
grains with a low albedo.  The minimum required albedo is approximately 
$\omega \approx 0.5$ implying relatively large grain radii.  As previously 
discussed, the larger the grain radius the larger the mass of dust required 
to reproduce the same optical depth.  Figure \ref{MRN} illustrates the fit 
for the day 714 H$\alpha$ profile for the case where a classic MRN 
\citep{Mathis1977} grain radius distribution is adopted, with $a_{min}=0.005 
\mu$m, $a_{max}=0.25~\mu$m and $n(a) \propto a^{-3.5}$.  It can be seen 
clearly that the extended red wing is significantly underestimated.  
Since the albedo of amorphous carbon grains varies significantly with 
grain radius (see Figure \ref{albedo_grain}) I can establish a strong 
lower bound to the mean dust grain radius, which I estimate to be $a \ge 
0.35~\mu$m.  This is the smallest grain radius that is still capable of 
reproducing the red scattering wing at all epochs and I therefore use 
this lower limit value throughout my smooth density modelling.


The inner and outer radii of the ejecta are calculated at each epoch from 
the maximum velocity used, the day number and the specified ratio 
$R_{in}/R_{out}$.  The radii generated are consistent with those used in 
previous models of SN~1987A (\citealt{Ercolano2007}, W15) and the 
minimum velocities for both the [O~{\sc i}] and H$\alpha$ line emitting 
regions are relatively consistent with those obtained by \citet{Kozma1998b} 
who estimate that  hydrogen extends into the core to a depth of 
$\lesssim 700$~km~s$^{-1}$ and the oxygen reaches down to $\sim 
400$~km~s$^{-1}$.  They are also consistent with predictions from 3D 
explosion models at the time of shock-breakout that predict the oxygen to 
reach to a depth of $\sim 200$~km~s$^{-1}$ 
\citep{Hammer2010,Wongwathanarat2015}. Figures \ref{Ha} to 
\ref{OI_smooth} show the best fits to the data for days 714 to 3604 
whilst Table \ref{smooth1} details the parameters used.

It can be seen from Tables \ref{smooth1} to \ref{clumped2} that, in order 
to reproduce the blueshifts seen in the [O~{\sc 
i}]~$\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ doublet, considerably larger dust masses are 
required than to fit the H$\alpha$ line at the same epoch.  Although the 
same maximum velocities and therefore outer radii are used in my [O~{\sc 
i}] and H$\alpha$ models, the inner radii for the [O~{\sc i}] models are 
significantly smaller and the density distribution much steeper.  This 
implies that [O~{\sc i}] is concentrated towards the centre of the 
ejecta whereas H$\alpha$ is more diffuse.  This is broadly in 
agreement with 3D explosion dynamics models that suggest that a few hours 
after the explosion the heavier elements will, in comparison to hydrogen, 
be located more centrally in the ejecta with ``bullets" of heavier 
material reaching the outer edges \citep{Hammer2010}.  If dust is forming 
in the inner regions of the ejecta then the majority of the [O~{\sc i}] 
emission must travel through the newly formed dust whereas the more 
diffuse H$\alpha$ emission has a greater chance of escaping unaffected.  
This may explain the difference between the dust masses needed for the 
[O~{\sc i}] and H$\alpha$ models.

\subsection{Clumped Dust Models for SN~1987A}
\label{clumped_models}

A number of investigators have presented arguments for the material in the 
ejecta of SN~1987A being clumped \citep{Lucy1991,Li1992,Kozma1998b} and so 
I consider clumped models for the ejecta dust to be more realistic than 
smoothly distributed dust models. It has been shown through the modelling 
of optical-IR SEDs that when dust is assumed to have a clumped 
distribution then the derived dust masses can be significantly larger than 
for the case of dust that is distributed smoothly between the inner and 
outer radii (e.g. \citet{Ercolano2007,Owen2015}). I present in Figures \ref{d1862_3604} and \ref{d1862_3604_2} two sets of 
fits to the line profile based on the clumped dust modelling of W15, one 
set with a minimum grain radius and one set with a maximum grain radius.  
Each fit is based on the best fitting smooth model such that the photon 
packets are emitted assuming a smooth radial density profile.  However, 
the dust is no longer coupled to the gas but instead is located entirely 
in clumps of size $R_{out}/25$.  The clumps are distributed stochastically 
between $R_{in}$ and $R_{out}$ with the probability of a given grid cell 
being a clump proportional to $r^{- \beta }$ where $i(r) \propto r^{-2 
\beta}$.  The number of clumps used is determined by the clump filling 
factor $f$ which is kept constant at $f=0.1$.  All properties are fixed 
from the smooth models with the exception of the grain radius, density 
profile exponent ($\beta$) and the total dust mass.

\label{d1862_3604}
\end{figure}

Models were again constructed using the smallest possible grain radius (a=0.6~$\mu$m in the clumped case) in order to derive minimum dust masses 
for clumped distributions.  By considering the extent of the red 
scattering wing, upper limits to the grain radius were also derived with the 
purpose of limiting the maximum dust mass at each epoch.  By steadily 
reducing the grain radius from an initial value of 5~$\mu$m (motivated by 
the maximum possible grain radius derived by W15 for their day 8515 model), 
I produced a set of models with a maximum grain radius of $a=3.5~\mu$m.

\label{d1862_3604_2}
\end{figure}

The increase in grain radius from the smooth case to the clumped case is 
necessary in order to have a slightly larger albedo.  Grains of radius 
$a=0.35~\mu$m do not reproduce the red side of the profiles well for a 
clumped medium.  This is because when the dust is located in clumps the 
radiation is subject to less scattering as well as to less absorption.  
The reduction in scattering appears not to be compensated for by the 
increased dust mass and a larger grain radius is therefore required, 
particularly at day 714.

For all but the H$\alpha$ line at days 714 and 806 a similar fit could be 
obtained with either a grain radius of $a=0.6~\mu$m or $a=3.5~\mu$m (see 
Figures \ref{Ha} to \ref{d1862_3604_2}).  However, for H$\alpha$ 
at days 714 and 806 even a small change to the grain radius from 0.6~$\mu$m resulted in a 
significantly poorer fit, either over-estimating or under-estimating the red wing. 
I therefore conclude that the dust mass estimates produced for the 
H$\alpha$ lines at days 714 and 806 for a grain radius of $a=0.6~\mu$m are 
the best H$\alpha$-based estimates of the dust mass at this epoch.



In my subsequent analyses, I adopt the values derived from my clumped 
models.  Details of the parameters used are presented in 
Tables \ref{clumped1} and \ref{clumped2} and the fits are presented in Figures 
\ref{Ha} to \ref{d1862_3604_2}.

\subsection{Goodness of Fit}
I detailed at the start of Section \ref{results} the process by which parameters were constrained in order to obtain good fits to the data.  These fits were judged both by eye and by minimising the mean square error between the model and the observed data for each line profile.  The sensitivity of the fits to various parameters may be of interest and so, in Tables \ref{MSE_mass} and \ref{MSE_beta}, I detail the mean square error (MSE) for the H$\alpha$ profile at days 714 and 2875 for a range of dust masses and density profile exponents.    All other parameters were kept fixed at their best-fitting values for the clumped models of H$\alpha$ with a grain radius $a=0.6$~$\mu$m as in Table \ref{clumped1}.  The line profiles for these models are presented in Figures \ref{fig:MSE1} to \ref{fig:MSE4}.  The MSE is calculated as
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{N} \sum_i (f_{obs,i} - f_{mod,i})^2
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N$ is the number of data points, $f_{obs,i}$ is the observed flux at the $i^{th}$ data point 
and $f_{mod,i}$ is the modelled flux at the $i^{th}$ data point. The MSEs were calculated between $-5000$~km~s$^{-1}$ and $+7000$~km~s$^{-1}$ for the day 714 H$\alpha$ profile and between $-8000$~km~s$^{-1}$ and $+8000$~km~s$^{-1}$ for the day 2875 H$\alpha$ profile.  Note that the MSEs should only be compared between models for a given observed line profile and not between different line profiles since each observation is associated with a different inherent error.

For day 714, I find that increasing or decreasing the total dust mass by a factor of two with all other parameters fixed causes a substantial increase in the mean square error (by factors of 23 and 8.6 respectively) effectively ruling out these values.  For day 2875 a similar variation is seen but with the MSE varying by factors of 1.4 and 3.0 for each case.  The narrower range of MSEs at day 2875 compared to day 714 is due to a noisier profile which results in a greater allowed range of good fits.   The sensitivity of the goodness of fit to the dust mass and density profile is similar for the other modelled epochs.

\subsection{The Effects of Clumping}

As in the case of SED radiative transfer models, the dust masses required 
to reproduce the observations in the clumped scenario are considerably 
higher than for the smooth scenario.  The dust masses differ between my 
smooth models for $a=0.35~\mu$m and clumped models for $a=0.6$~$\mu$m by a 
factor of approximately 3.  The dust mass estimates are even larger when
comparing clumped $a=0.6~\mu$m models to clumped $a=3.5~\mu$m models at 
later epochs. This does not take into account the increase in grain radius 
between the two cases however.  This increase accounts for a reasonable 
fraction of this difference. I estimate the effects of clumping alone to 
increase the required dust mass by a factor of approximately 1.5-2.0 from 
the smooth case.


\subsection{More Complex Models}
\label{complex}

Where blue-shifted lines are observed in the spectra of CCSNe it is often the case that the Balmer lines of HI are less affected than the [O~{\sc i}] lines \citep{Milisavljevic2012}.  This may be due to a difference in the location or distribution of the emitting elements; if the neutral hydrogen was diffusely distributed throughout the envelope but the oxygen was co-located with the dust in the core and in clumps then this could result in [O~{\sc i}] emission undergoing greater attenuation than H$\alpha$.  This geometry would be in line with previous models of SN~1987A that suggested that the dust-forming regions are likely to include those which are oxygen-rich \citep{Kozma1998a}.  Clearly, any model of dust formation in the ejecta of a CCSN must consistently reproduce all of the line profiles at a given epoch.  The models presented in this paper thus far have coupled the gas and dust distributions for a fixed clump volume filling factor and clump size.  The H$\alpha$ and [O~{\sc i}] models therefore require different dust masses with the [O~{\sc i}] models usually requiring a dust mass $\sim4$ times larger than the H$\alpha$ models. 

I now present a model that reconciles this difference by additionally varying the clump filling factor, clump size and emissivity distribution.  I assume that neutral hydrogen is likely diffuse throughout the ejecta and so maintains a smoothly distributed power-law emissivity distribution between $R_{in}$ and $R_{out}$ for H$\alpha$.  However, I now assume that dust mostly forms in dense regions of high metallicity and so restrict the [O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ emission to originate entirely from the dusty clumps.  As previously discussed, the greater the covering factor of the dust the greater the albedo required in order to reproduce the H$\alpha$ red scattering wing. In order to obtain both the strong blue-shifting of the [O~{\sc i}] line and the extended red scattering wing observed in H$\alpha$ a small number of dense clumps were required along with a small mass of diffusely distributed highly scattering dust in the inter-clump medium.


In order to fit both line profiles simultaneously, I required a very high albedo ($\omega > 0.8$) that demanded the inclusion of some fraction of silicate dust. Amorphous carbon grains alone are incapable of producing this level of scattering for any grain radius.  I adopted a grain radius of $a=0.6$~$\mu$m, the same as that used in my initial clumped models and I varied the relative proportions of amorphous carbon and MgSiO$_3$ in order to achieve the necessary albedo.  The adopted grain densities were $\rho_c=1.85$~g~cm$^{-3}$ for amorphous carbon grains and $\rho_s = 2.71$~g~cm$^{-3}$ for MgSiO$_3$.  The resulting dust model for day 714 used 75\% MgSiO$_3$ and 25\% amorphous carbon by cross-sectional area with a volume filling factor $f_V=0.1$ and a clump size $R_{out}/5$.  90\% of the dust mass was located in clumps with the remaining 10\% distributed smoothly between $R_{in}$ and $R_{out}$ according to a power law $\rho \propto r$. Clumps were distributed stochastically with probability $\propto r^{-8}$ compared to $r^{-2.7}$ in my standard models discussed earlier. Equal numbers of [O~{\sc i}] packets were emitted from each clump. The increased steepness of the density profile is required to compensate for the clumped packet emission relative to the previous smooth distribution.  Since the clumps are distributed stochastically according to the density profile, less flux is emitted from the central regions in a clumped emission model than in a smooth distribution model (since there are gaps between the clumps).  In order to obtain a sufficiently steeply rising line profile, the density profile must therefore be steepened in clumped emission models. The adopted value of $\beta$ does not significantly affect the best-fitting values of the other parameters of interest however.  H$\alpha$ emission was distributed smoothly according to an emitting density power law $\rho(r) \propto r^{-1.3}$.  $R_{out}$ was the same for all components (i.e. clumped dust, diffuse dust, [O~{\sc i}] emission and H$\alpha$ emission) and was calculated using a maximum velocity of 3250~km~s$^{-1}$.  The inner radius was $R_{in} = 0.07 R_{out}$ for all components except the smooth H$\alpha$ emission which was emitted between $R_{in}=0.25R_{out}$ and $R_{out}$.

\label{HaOImod}
\end{figure}

The total dust mass used was $M_{dust}=2.3 \times 10^{-4}$~M$_{\odot}$.  This dust mass is very similar to that derived from my original clumped models of [O~{\sc i}] using amorphous carbon grains of radius $a=0.6$~$\mu$m.  The slight increase over my amorphous carbon dust mass of $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$~M$_{\odot}$ is largely due to the higher grain density of MgSiO$_3$.  At this grain radius amorphous carbon and MgSiO$_3$ have similar extinction efficiencies and so the change in species and geometry does not substantially alter the dust mass. I therefore adopt the [O~{\sc i}] dust masses in my further analyses and consider the differences in my derived dust masses between H$\alpha$ and [O~{\sc i}] to be the result of the clumped emission of [O~{\sc i}].


Fits to both the [O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ and H$\alpha$ lines for day 714 using these parameters are presented in Figure \ref{HaOImod}.

\subsection{The Effect of a Grain Radius Distribution}
\label{gs_distn}

%It is important to consider the potential effect on the dust mass of 
%modelling a grain radius distribution instead of a single grain radius.  For a 
%grain radius distribution the overall extinction cross section, $C_{ext}$, 
%at a given wavelength is
%
%\begin{equation}
% C_{ext}=\int^{a_{max}}_{a_{min}} Q_{ext}(a) n(a) \pi a^2 da 
% \end{equation}
%
%where $Q_{ext}(a)$ is the extinction efficiency for a grain radius $a$ and 
%$n(a)$ is the number of grains with size $a$. The overall extinction 
%efficiency is then
%
%\begin{equation}
% Q_{ext} = \frac{C_{ext}}{ \int^{a_{max}}_{a_{min}} n(a) \pi a^2 da} 
% \end{equation}
 
%The scattering cross-section $Q_{sca}$ is similarly calculated.  As a 
%result of these calculations, there is rarely a single grain radius that has 
%the same albedo and extinction efficiency as a size distribution.  
%Modelling a size distribution may therefore alter the deduced dust mass.  
%Since the models are only sensitive to the overall optical depth and 
%albedo, it is not possible to deduce the grain radius range or distribution 
%and only single grain radius are investigated (as presented above).
%
%Whilst this apparently limits the scope of the results, it is useful to 
%consider the extent to which different grain radius distributions would 
%alter the derived dust masses.  By considering a number of grain radius 
%ranges and adopting a power law distribution with a variable exponent, I 
%may gain some insight into the effects of adopting a distribution rather 
%than a single size.  



% I may 
%then approximately calculate the required dust mass as
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{distn_conv}
%M_{d}= \frac{M_s Q_{ext,s}(a_s)}{a_s} \times \frac{\int^{a_{max}}_{a_{min}} n(a) a^3 da}{\int^{a_{max}}_{a_{min}} Q_{ext}(a) n(a) a^2 da}
%\end{equation}
%
%where the subscript $s$ represents the single grain radius quantities and 
%the $d$ subscript represents quantities for the grain radius distribution.

All of the models heretofore have been based on a single grain radius.  As previously discussed in Chapter \ref{chp:chp4}, it is important to consider the possible effects of a dust grain radius distribution.  This is more likely to be the case in reality and potentially has a significant effect on the derived dust mass.  

 As discussed in Section \ref{smooth_models}, for a classical MRN power law ($n(a) \propto a^{-3.5}$) with a wide grain radius range ($a_{min} = 0.001~\mu$m to $a_{max} = 4.0~\mu$m) the derived albedo is much too small to reproduce the required wing seen at early epochs.  I therefore adopt an approach whereby, for a number of grain radius ranges, I adjust the exponent of the distribution until the overall albedo is the same as that seen for the best fitting single grain radius for the clumped distributions. Using Equation \ref{distn_conv} from Chapter \ref{chp:chp4}, I calculate the required dust masses for the clumped H$\alpha$ model on day 714 for a selection of distributions with varying $a_{min}$.  These are presented in Table \ref{tb_distn}.  
 
 It can be seen that in all cases, a larger dust mass is required for grain radius distributions in order to reproduce the same profile as a single grain radius.  The conversion factors presented in the table are valid for any model with grain radius $a=0.6~\mu$m and may therefore also be applied to the models for day 806.  I repeated the process for $a=3.5~\mu$m but found that, in order to reproduce the required albedo, the distribution had to be heavily weighted towards the larger grains and that the value of $a_{min}$ had no effect on the required dust mass.  Increasing the value of $a_{min}$ to larger values ($>2~\mu$m) does not have a significant effect either.  This is because both extinction efficiency and albedo tend to a constant value with increasing grain radius and the adoption of different grain radius ranges and distributions above a certain threshold results in only insignificant variations in these quantities.

I conclude that if a distribution of grain radii is indeed present, the 
deduced single size dust masses are likely to under-estimate the true mass 
of newly formed dust.

\subsection{The Effect of Different Grain Species}
\label{species}

In my analyses so far, I have mostly focussed on amorphous carbon as the 
species of interest.  This was motivated by previously published early epoch optical 
and IR SED analyses that found that the silicate mass fraction must be  limited to $\leq$15\% (\citealt{Ercolano2007}, W15).  The recent suggestion by 
\citet{Dwek2015} that large masses of the  glassy silicate MgSiO$_3$ 
may have formed at early epochs is discussed further in the next 
subsection.  As previously discussed in Chapter \ref{chp:chp4}, the parameters that affect the quantity of dust required by 
my models are the mean albedo and optical depth of the dust and there could therefore
be multiple combinations of grain species and sizes that result in a good 
fit to the data.

In Chapter \ref{chp:chp4}, I evaluated the required change in dust mass when a medium of 100\% 
silicates was used instead of amorphous carbon (see Equation \ref{species_conversion}). 
%Using the astronomical 
%silicate optical constants of \cite{Draine1984}, which are `dirtier' (with 
%lower albedos) than the glassy pure MgSiO$_3$ sample of \citet{Jager2003}. 
%In a similar manner to the approach detailed in Section \ref{gs_distn}, I 
%can calculate the mass of DL silicate that gives a fit equivalent to that 
%for a single carbon grain radius.  I consider the albedo for the grain 
%radius needed for the best fit amorphous carbon model, calculate the 
%equivalent grain radius for DL silicate that gives the same albedo and 
%then calculate a new dust mass by allowing for the change in the 
%extinction cross-section:
%
%\begin{equation}
%M_{sil} = M_{amc} \Big( \frac{Q_{amc}}{Q_{sil}} \Big) \Big(\frac{a_{sil}}{a_{amc}}\Big) \Big(\frac{\rho_{sil}}{\rho_{amC}}\Big)
%\end{equation}

Because of the nature of the variation of albedo with grain radius for the 
\citet{Draine1984} astronomical silicate (see Figure \ref{albedo_grain}), 
there is often more than one silicate grain radius that will give rise to 
the same albedo at a given wavelength.  Some of the possibilities and the 
resulting mass conversion factors between media composed of 100\% Zubko BE amorphous carbon and 100\% Draine \& Lee silicates derived using Equation \ref{species_conversion} in Chapter \ref{chp:chp4} are given in Table \ref{tb_sil}.  For 
my best fitting amorphous carbon models with $a=0.6~\mu$m (the first two 
entries in Table \ref{tb_sil}), using any fraction of silicates with 
either $a=0.6~\mu$m or $a=3.5~\mu$m would increase the dust mass.  
However, 
for the case of an amorphous carbon grain radius of $a=3.5~\mu$m (the last 
three entries), using silicate dust would reduce the dust mass by a factor 
of between 0.49 - 0.65 relative to my amorphous carbon values.

changes on going from amorphous carbon to silicates.}

\subsection{Modelling Large Masses of Dust at Early Epochs: Comparison 
with the Results of \citet{Dwek2015}}
\label{dwek}

In a recent analysis of infrared SED data, DA15 suggested that it may be possible for a large mass (0.4~M$_\odot$) of 
MgSiO$_3$ silicate dust to have been present in SN~1987A even at 
relatively early epochs ($t\sim615$ days), since that species has very low 
IR emissivities.  Up to this point I have constructed models using 
\citet{Zubko1996} BE amorphous carbon dust but in the previous section I 
discussed the effect on derived dust masses of instead using 
\citet{Draine1984} astronomical silicate, which has higher optical and IR 
emissivities than the glassy MgSiO$_3$ species considered by DA15. 
%My clumping structure in my models was based on that used by W15.

doublet components was 2.2. All other parameters are the same as in 
Table \ref{clumped1}.  MSE values for all of the above fits are very similar (around MSE$=0.035$).}
\label{Dwek_models_OI}
\end{figure}

I now consider models for day 714 based on the grain types
used by DA15.  I adopt a clumped structure equivalent to the 
preferred model of DA15 who considered 1000 clumps with a filling factor of 
0.09 and a negligible dust mass in the inter-clump medium.  I calculate 
the effective spherical radius of my clumps by equating the volume of my 
cubic clumps to a sphere of radius $R_{eff}$.  Clumps of width 
$R_{out}/14$ generate the desired $R_{eff}/R_{out}=0.044$ equivalent to 
that of DA15.  In my code, using a filling factor of 0.09 then generates 
1034 clumps, similar to the number used by DA15.  I ran a series of models 
(presented in Figures \ref{Dwek_models_Ha} and \ref{Dwek_models_OI}) for 
both the H$\alpha$ and [O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ line profiles.  
In each case I modelled the lines using a dust grain mixture as described 
by DA15 such that the medium comprised 18\% amorphous carbon and 82\% 
MgSiO$_3$ by volume.  I adopted the same optical constants as used in 
their work (i.e. \citet{Jager2003} for MgSiO$_3$ grains and 
\citet{Zubko1996} for amorphous carbon) and the same grain mass densities as DA15, 
$\rho_s=3.2$~g~cm$^{-3}$ and $\rho_c=1.8$~g~cm$^{-3}$.  In addition to 
modelling their composite grain case, I also considered three single 
species models, using Zubko BE amorphous carbon, MgSiO$_3$, and 
MgFeSiO$_4$ (in the latter two cases the optical constants were taken from 
\citet{Jager1994} and \citet{Dorschner1995}). For each species I 
adopted the smallest single grain radius that has an albedo of $\omega 
\approx 0.6$. The ejecta 
parameters were as listed in Table \ref{clumped1}, with the exception of 
the smooth gas density distributions which I took to be $\rho(r) \propto r^{-1.3}$ 
for H$\alpha$ and $\rho(r) \propto r^{-2.3}$ for [O~{\sc i}] in order to 
optimise the best fits.

For each species, two models are presented.  The first adopts the minimum 
possible dust mass that provides a reasonable fit to the observed line 
profiles and the second uses the dust mass derived by DA15 for that 
specific species ($M=0.4~M_{\odot}$ for MgSiO$_3$ and $M=0.047~M_{\odot}$ 
for amorphous carbon giving a total composite dust mass of 
$M=0.447~M_{\odot}$).  I also adopted a dust mass of $M=0.447~M_{\odot}$ for MgFeSiO$_4$.  Results 
from the models are presented in Figures \ref{Dwek_models_Ha} and 
\ref{Dwek_models_OI}.





The [O~{\sc i}] models can display similar profiles for substantially 
different dust masses.  This is a result of the relatively high optical 
depths within the clumps themselves. If a clump is optically thick then 
the majority of radiation that hits it will be absorbed and the profile 
becomes insensitive to how much dust is actually contained within the 
clump.  For my [O~{\sc i}] minimum dust mass models, the optical depths 
within a clump over an effective clump radius $R_{eff}$ at 6300~\AA\ are 
around $\tau_{clump} \approx 0.4$.  Over the entire nebula optical depths 
are very high and $\sim$72\% of the total flux is absorbed.  Increasing the 
total dust mass therefore has only a small effect on the emergent line 
profile and once $\tau_{clump}>1$ then the line profile remains unchanged 
for increasingly large dust masses.  It is because of this fact that I 
present only the smallest dust mass capable of reproducing the [O~{\sc i}] 
profiles seen in Figure \ref{Dwek_models_OI}.  The insensitivity of the 
[O~{\sc i}] profiles to dust mass is not the case for the H$\alpha$ 
profile models (where $\tau_{clump} < 0.05$ for all of my minimum dust mass models) and the 
H$\alpha$-fit dust masses presented in Figure \ref{Dwek_models_Ha} 
therefore represent the most sensitive diagnostic of the dust mass for 
each grain type.  All of my models discussed in previous sections have 
significantly smaller clump optical depths ($\tau_{clump}<0.1$), making 
them sensitive to dust mass variations.

For all the [O~{\sc i}] line profile models, except for those using pure 
MgSiO$_3$ or pure Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ dust, the required dust masses are 
significantly less than those proposed by DA15. The [O~{\sc i}] profile 
obtained using DA15's very large MgSiO$_3$ dust mass of 0.4~M$_{\odot}$ 
provides a reasonable fit, but the same dust mass significantly 
overestimates the blueshifting of the H$\alpha$ line 
(Figure~\ref{Dwek_models_Ha}). I can place an upper limit on the 
mass of pure MgSiO$_3$ on day 714 of 0.07~M$_\odot$, as this 
is the highest mass for which a fit to the observed H$\alpha$ profile can 
be obtained (Figure~\ref{Dwek_models_OI}).

\label{ha_dwek_bf}
\end{figure}

Pure MgSiO$_3$ is extremely glassy, with very high albedos in the optical 
for a wide range of grain radii.  At grain radii small enough to reduce 
the albedo to $\omega \approx 0.6$, in order to fit the observed line 
profiles, the extinction efficiency in the optical becomes extremely low 
(see Figure \ref{albedo_grain}), with large masses of dust therefore 
required in order to produce even a small amount of line absorption. 
However, for a given albedo, the extinction efficiencies increase by large 
factors if either carbon or iron is included in the grain. In the 
composite grain model the amorphous carbon component dominates the overall 
extinction due to its much larger extinction efficiency at small grain 
radii. Similarly, for MgFeSiO$_4$ (or Mg$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$SiO$_3$) grains
the iron component leads to much larger optical and IR extinction
efficiencies and much lower dust mass upper limits.
If the dust that formed at early epochs contained some fraction of 
elements such as carbon, iron or aluminium, yielding `dirtier' silicate 
grains or composite grains, then fits to the observed blue-shifted line 
profiles imply low dust masses. I conclude that for dust masses as large
as 0.07~M$_\odot$ to have been present in SN~1987A's ejecta as early as 
days 600-1000 then the dust would have to have been formed of glassy pure 
magnesium silicates.

In order to be certain that there was no set of parameters for which a dust mass of $M=0.447M_{\odot}$ comprising 82\% MgSiO$_3$ and 18\% amorphous carbon by volume could result in a good fit, a thorough investigation of the variable parameters was performed.  Having fixed the clump size, filling factor, dust mass and composition as per the values detailed above and in DA15, I varied the density profile ($\beta$) and grain radius $a$.  Varying the maximum velocity and the ratio of the inner and outer radii was found to have little effect on the goodness of fit.  The MSE for the H$\alpha$ profile presented in the upper left panel of Figure \ref{Dwek_models_Ha} was 0.71 (in units of 10$^{-13}$~ergs~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$).  This was improved to 0.54 by increasing the grain radius to $a=0.6$~$\mu$m and the density profile exponent to $\beta=1.5$, which represents the best fit that I could achieve using the values described by DA15 and a dust mass of $M=0.447M_{\odot}$ presented in Figure \ref{ha_dwek_bf}.  However, the overall best fit I obtain for this scenario (see the lower left panel of \ref{Dwek_models_Ha}) used a much lower dust mass of $M=5 \times 10^{-4}M_{\odot}$ giving an MSE=0.0058, substantially improving the fit.

The evolution of the SN~1987A H$\alpha$ and [O~{\sc 
i}]$\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ line fluxes over time has been discussed 
previously by, for example, \citet{Li1992}, \citet{Xu1992} and 
\citet{Kozma1998b}. I may use my clumped models to predict the 
unattenuated 
emitted line fluxes and consider their evolution through time.  For each 
model, the fraction of the total line energy absorbed by the dust was 
predicted.  I determined the total flux for each observed line profile 
and used the absorbed fraction from my clumped models for $a=3.5$~$\mu$m to 
predict the undepleted flux of the line before attenuation by the dust.  
Gaps in the observed data due to contamination by narrow line emission 
were interpolated over in order to estimate the flux of the broad line 
component. The observed H$\alpha$ luminosities and predicted undepleted 
luminosities are given in Table \ref{tau_e2} along with the energy fraction 
absorbed by the dust in each model. No correction has been made for 
interstellar extinction along the sightline to SN~1987A.
There is very little change in 
these values if I adopt the models with $a=0.6~\mu$m instead of 
$a=3.5~\mu$m.  Plots of the observed and undepleted line luminosities are 
given for all modelled epochs of H$\alpha$ and [O~{\sc i}] in Figure 
\ref{undep}.


I also present power-law fits to the time evolution of the unattenuated 
H$\alpha$ and [O~{\sc i}] line fluxes.  For H$\alpha$, I find that 
$L_{\rm H\alpha}(t) \propto t^{-4.15}$ between days 714 and 3604.  I can 
compare this value to the theoretical time dependence of the flux of a 
recombination line based on the dynamics of the ejecta for an 
environment in a Hubble-type flow $r=vt$.  For a frozen-in ionisation 
structure, the mean intensity of a recombination or collisionally-excited 
line per unit volume is locally proportional to the product of the 
densities of the recombining species i.e. $J_{\rm H\alpha} \propto n_e n_p 
\propto n_e^2$.  The total luminosity of the line is therefore dependent 
on the volume $V$ as $L_{\rm H\alpha} \propto 1/V $.  Assuming a constant 
maximum expansion velocity, the luminosity should vary with time as 
$L_{\rm H\alpha}(t) \propto t^{-3}$.

This relationship is only true for a constant ionisation fraction.  This 
``freeze-out" phase is estimated to have begun at $\sim 800$ days and 
first sets in at lower density high velocity regions, gradually moving 
inwards with time \citep{Danziger1991,Fransson1993}.  Since my modelling 
begins at day 714, the ionisation fraction in the inner higher density 
regions is likely still decreasing due to recombination during my first 
two epochs.  This presumably accounts for the slightly steeper 
$L_{\rm H\alpha}(t) \propto t^{-4.15}$ that I find across all epochs.  
\citet{Kozma1998b} estimate that H$\alpha$ emission from the outer regions 
begins to dominate over H$\alpha$ emission from core regions for t $>$ 
900 days. If earlier epochs are ignored, the last five epochs ($t \ge 
1862$ days) plotted in (Figure \ref{undep}) exhibit a shallower trend that 
is in good agreement with the expected $L_{\rm H\alpha}(t) \propto t^{-3}$ 
evolution.

The [O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ doublet exhibits a much 
steeper evolution, $L_{\rm [OI]}(t) \propto t^{-7.2}$, than the H$\alpha$ line 
(Figure \ref{undep}). These collisionally excited lines are very sensitive 
to the gas temperature, with emissivities that fall to low values for 
temperatures below $\sim$3000~K. The models of \citet{Li1992} and \citet{Kozma1998a} predict that the gas temperature in the relevant [O~{\sc i}] emitting 
regions should have fallen below 1000~K after day $\sim$1000.





\section{Discussion}
\label{discuss}

Using Monte Carlo models that consider both the absorbing and scattering 
effects of dust, I have modelled the evolution of the H$\alpha$ and 
[O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ line profiles over time, enabling me 
to place constraints on the evolution of newly formed dust in the ejecta 
of SN~1987A.

As can be seen in Figures \ref{d1862_3604} and \ref{d1862_3604_2}, even a small degree of 
asymmetry in observed supernova line profiles can be indicative of dust 
formation within the ejecta.  In addition to this, a line profile that is 
consistently asymmetric through time requires increasingly large dust 
masses to account for a similar degree of blue-shifting since the 
expansion of the ejecta would otherwise cause the dust optical depth to 
the edge of the ejecta to be reduced.

In Section \ref{dwek} I compared my results with those of \citet{Dwek2015} and 
concluded that large dust masses can only have been present at early 
epochs if the grains were formed purely of glassy magnesium silicates that 
contained no iron or carbon component and that even for pure magnesium 
silicates no more than 0.07~M$_\odot$ of dust could have been present. I now 
compare my results with those of \citet{Lucy1989} and W15.

\citet{Lucy1989} analysed the [O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ doublet 
for SN~1987A and estimated dust optical depths for a number of epochs. 
They translated these into dust masses for day 775 only. From my smooth 
flow modelling of the [O~{\sc i}] doublets I obtain $\tau_V \approx 3.60$ at day 
714 and $\tau_V \approx 2.86$ at day 806.  These values are higher 
than the values given by \citet{Lucy1989} who derived $\tau_V=1.19$ at day 
725 and $\tau_V=1.25$ at day 775.  The value of the assumed albedo 
accounts for the majority of this discrepancy.  \citet{Lucy1989} 
considered line profiles before and after dust condensation and concluded 
that any evidence of an extended red scattering wing was unconvincing.  
Accordingly, they adopted a model with perfectly absorbing dust ($\omega = 
0$).  For my amorphous carbon models for the [O~{\sc 
i}]~$\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ profile using a grain radius $a=0.35$~$\mu$m, I 
obtain an albedo of approximately $\omega = 0.5$ at $\lambda=6300$ \AA.

The dust masses derived by \citet{Lucy1989} at day 775 (e.g. $M_{dust}=4.4 
\times 10^{-6} M_{\odot}$ for amorphous carbon) are  
different to those obtained from my smooth dust modelling of the [O~{\sc 
i}]~$\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ doublet at day 806 ($M_{dust}=1.5 \times 
10^{-4} M_{\odot}$ for amorphous carbon).  There are three main reasons 
for the discrepancy.  Firstly, the albedo is significantly larger in my 
modelling as already discussed.  A larger dust mass is therefore required 
to produce the same amount of absorption.  Secondly, the observed H$\alpha$ line profiles on day 714 and later {\em do} show an extended red scattering wing (see Figures \ref{Ha} and \ref{smooth_late}) and to match the extended 
red wing my required grain radius is considerably larger than the small 
grains ($a < 0.1$~$\mu$m) adopted by \citet{Lucy1989}. Larger grain radii 
reduce the total cross-section of interaction per unit mass and so a greater dust mass 
must be present to compensate for this. Finally, my adopted maximum 
velocities on days 714 and 806 (3250~km~s$^{-1}$ and 4000~km~s$^{-1}$) are larger than the value adopted 
by \citet{Lucy1989} (1870~km~s$^{-1}$).  The larger value of $V_{max}$ 
increases the total volume of the ejecta significantly and therefore 
significantly more dust is required to produce the same optical depth.

\citet{Lucy1989} also noted that the dust optical depth increased rapidly 
after day 580 and that the rate of increase of the dust optical depth 
appeared to slow between day 670 and day 775, the latest day that they 
considered.  My results, for both clumped and smooth models, suggest that 
the dust optical depth actually drops between day 714 and day 806 before 
starting to increase again at later epochs.  This is consistent with the 
results of \citet{Lucy1989} where the slowing rate of increase of dust 
optical depth could be consistent with a turning point subsequent to day 
775.

I can also compare my dust masses with the mass estimates derived from 
SED-fitting by W15 (see Figure \ref{Mdust}).  W15 used a sigmoid fit to 
their dust mass evolution, of the form
\begin{equation}
M_d(t)=ae^{be^{ct}}
\end{equation}
 
\noindent where $a=1.0M_{\odot}$ (representing the limiting dust mass), 
$b=-8.53$ and $c=-0.0004$.  Both their dust masses and this sigmoid fit 
are shown in Figure \ref{Mdust}.  It exhibits an initial period of slow 
growth in mass followed by an intermediate period of accelerating growth 
followed by another slowing until a plateau is ultimately reached.  In 
this sense it may be representative of the process of dust 
formation whereby initial conditions appropriate for grain growth 
gradually develop until optimal conditions are reached at an intermediate 
epoch when grain growth is at its fastest before conditions for grain growth once again 
deteriorate and, due e.g. to a depletion of the available gas-phase heavy element atom reservoirs, the rate slows again (as discussed by W15).  Performing a 
least-squares regression to this function using just my own derived 
clumped dust masses, I obtain a sigmoid fit with coefficients 
$a=1.0M_{\odot}$, $b=-10.0$ and $c=-0.0004$.  These values are 
remarkably similar to those derived by W15.  This sigmoid fit is also 
plotted in Figure \ref{Mdust}.

I find that at all epochs the dust masses derived by W15 are entirely 
within the dust mass ranges determined by my models.

My sigmoid fit to the mean of the maximum and 
minimum dust masses does not take into account any systematic effects of 
grain growth.  At earlier epochs, whilst grains are 
still small relative to later epochs, the lower bound to the dust mass 
estimates may be more representative than the upper end; the reverse would 
be true at later epochs.
%%%%%%%new%%%%%%%%%%
This is in contrast to the sigmoid fit of W15, whose fits to their early 
epoch SEDs used an MRN distribution with grain radii between 0.005~$\mu$m 
and 0.25~$\mu$m, whilst their fits to their last two epochs required grain 
radii between 3.005~$\mu$m and 3.25~$\mu$m. The dust masses used for their 
sigmoid fit thus accounted for the effects of grain growth between the earlier 
and later epochs. As mentioned, I could not fit the extended red wings of 
the profiles at early epochs using an MRN distribution.  W15 found that at 
their earlier epochs they could not obtain SED fits with grain radii as 
large as $\sim 1.0~\mu$m. However, they did not consider radii in between 
these size ranges, such as the grains with $a \approx 0.6~\mu$m that I 
require at earlier epochs.  For SED modelling it is generally the case that 
the larger the grain radius used, the less dust is required to produce the 
same level of flux.  This may account for the differences between W15's 
earlier epoch dust masses and my own minimum dust mass estimates at 
similar epochs.  The models of W15 used 15\% silicate dust, in contrast to 
my models which used 100\% amorphous carbon dust.  This could also 
contribute to the differences at early epochs, as could the use of 
different sets of optical constants - I used the BE amorphous carbon 
optical constants of \citet{Zubko1996} whereas W15 used AC constants from 
\citet{Hanner1988}.  W15 found that in order to fit early epoch SEDs epochs 
(e.g. day 615) with Zubko ACH2 constants, smaller inner and outer ejecta 
radii were needed, with half as much dust ($5.0 \times 10^{-4}M_{\odot}$) 
compared to the Hanner AC results.

W15 derived a maximum possible grain radius at late epochs, concluding that 
the grains could not be larger than $\sim 5~\mu$m by day 8515. This is 
consistent with the maximum grain radii that I derive at my latest 
epochs.  I find that grain radii most likely cannot have exceeded $\sim 
3.5~\mu$m at day 3604 - the dust mass that I obtain using this grain 
radius is similar to the value predicted by W15's sigmoid fit at that 
epoch.

The relationship between ejecta dust grain radii and post-explosion 
time is important for understanding the likelihood of dust surviving the 
passage of a reverse shock propagating back through the ejecta. By the 
time the effects of a reverse shock begin to appear in the line profiles 
(around day 5000), my models imply that the grains could already be as 
large as several microns in radius and are likely to be larger than $\sim 
0.6~\mu$m. Grains as large as this are more likely to survive destruction 
by sputtering in supernova reverse shocks and in interstellar shocks 
\citep{Silvia2010, Silvia2012, Slavin2015}.
It has been suggested that very large grains (radii up to 4.2$~\mu$m) 
formed in the ejecta of SN 2010jl within a few hundred days after the 
explosion \citep{Gall2014}. The grain radii that W15 and I obtain 
for SN~1987A at very late epochs are nearly as large as found by 
\citet{Gall2014} for SN~2010jl, with both results suggesting that grains 
large enough to survive the destructive force of a reverse shock have 
formed by a few hundred days post-explosion. 

The dust masses obtained from my modelling of SN~1987A's line profiles 
support the conclusion of W15 that even after $\sim$3000 days the dust 
mass was still only a fraction of its current value. This contrasts with 
the results of \citet{Sarangi2015} whose grain chemistry models predict 
that ejecta dust masses should plateau by around 5 years after the 
explosion. My results show that SN~1987A's dust mass had reached of 
the order of $0.1M_{\odot}$ by day 3604.  Since its present dust mass is 
several times larger than this (\citealt{Matsuura2015}, W15), a 
substantial fraction of the current dust mass must have condensed after 
this epoch, in agreement with the conclusions of W15.

Ideally, my models would cover the entire evolution of SN~1987A's 
H$\alpha$ line profiles up to the present day.  However, the excitation of 
gas in the outer edges of the ejecta by the reverse shock after $\sim$ day 
5000 results in significant broad and asymmetric emission that 
dominates the original line profile \citep{Fransson2013}.  In addition to 
this, the narrow lines from the ER start to become so 
strong relative to the declining broad H$\alpha$ profile that, 
post-removal, not enough of the broad profile remained to be 
able to reliably infer information from the profile structure. These 
factors may be 
common to some other CCSNe that have interactions with surrounding 
circumstellar material. Care should also be taken to ensure that any 
observed late-time line profiles being modelled are not in fact the 
product of a light echo reflecting the spectrum from near maximum light. 
Nonetheless, detailed line modelling of asymmetric line profiles has 
proved effective in determining dust masses in the ejecta of SN~1987A at 
multiple epochs during the first ten years after outburst. The method 
clearly has wider application to other supernovae as demonstrated in Chapter \ref{chp:chp6}.


\section{Conclusions}

%I have investigated the effects of scattering and absorption by ejecta 
%dust on supernova line profile shapes and the different characteristic 
%features that may be produced.  In particular, attention is drawn to the 
%fact that a classical blue-shifted peak and asymmetric profile with most 
%flux on the blue side is not the only profile type that can signify the 
%presence of dust. In the case of strong dust scattering, line profiles can 
%have the majority of their flux on the red side. Even with just some dust 
%scattering, profiles can often exhibit an extended red scattering wing, 
%although care should be taken to ascertain that this cannot be accounted 
%for by electron scattering (electron scattering optical depths should 
%usually only be significant at very early epochs, $<$ 200 days). The line 
%peak should always lie on the blue side, with a line peak velocity that 
%will often correspond to the minimum velocity at the inner edge of the 
%ejecta shell. If not obscured by narrow circumstellar [N~{\sc ii}] 
%6584~\AA\ emission, a pronounced shoulder or corner may be present on the 
%red side of the profile, also corresponding to the minimum velocity at the 
%inner edge of the ejecta shell.

I have modelled the H$\alpha$ and [O~{\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$6300,6363~\AA\ 
line profiles from SN~1987A over a range of epochs and have obtained dust 
masses of the order of $0.1M_{\odot}$ by day 3604.  A sigmoid 
fit to my dust mass data predicts a current dust mass of 
0.68$M_{\odot}$, in line with current SED-based dust mass estimates for 
SN~1987A.  I find that large grains are necessary in order to reproduce 
 both the extended red scattering wings and the asymmetry seen in 
several of the lines and that grains larger than $0.6~\mu$m have formed by 
day 714, while by day 3604 grain radii of $\sim 3.5~\mu$m are needed. I 
find from fits to the H$\alpha$ profile that dust masses cannot have 
exceeded a few$\times10^{-3}$~M$_\odot$ on day 714 for all the grain types 
investigated, apart from glassy pure magnesium silicate grains, for which 
up to 0.07~M$_{\odot}$ can be fitted but that dust masses as large as the $0.4$~M$_{\odot}$ posited by DA15 for day 775 are ruled out by my line profile fits.

The observed red-blue line asymmetries persist right through to day 3604 
and beyond - if no further dust had formed after day $\sim$800 then the 
expansion of the ejecta  dust shell would cause dust optical depths 
to drop rapidly with time thereafter, leading to the disappearance of 
red-blue asymmetries. Just to maintain the observed degree of red-blue 
asymmetry seen at the earlier epochs therefore requires that dust must 
have continued to form beyond those epochs.
