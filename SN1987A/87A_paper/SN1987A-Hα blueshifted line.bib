abstract = {We investigate high-resolution line profiles of H$\alpha$, [Fe II] 7155A$\backslash$nand Ca II] 7291,7323 A in the spectra of SN 1987A. We identify a common$\backslash$nprominent narrow feature in all four lines. We attribute the emission to$\backslash$na fast knot of metals and hydrogen. Our observations provide the first$\backslash$ndirect evidence for mixing on a small as well as a large scale in the$\backslash$nejecta of SN 1987A. Our observations support the idea that such knots$\backslash$nmay well have contributed the bulk of the emission of the supernova$\backslash$nafter the ejecta cooled and dust formed at about day 500. The ratio of$\backslash$nthe two components of the blend of Ca II] 7291,7323A provides an upper$\backslash$nlimit on the number density of Ca\^{}+\^{} of 1 x 10\^{}5\^{} cm\^{}-3\^{} on day 673 for$\backslash$nboth the knot and the rest of the ejecta.},
