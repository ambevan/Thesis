@article{Tziamtzis2010,
	Abstract = {We used low resolution spectroscopy from VLT/FORS1, and high resolution spectra from VLT/UVES, to estimate the physical conditions in the ORs, using nebular analysis for emission lines such as [O II], [O III], [N II], and [S II]. We also measured the velocity at two positions of the ORs to test a geometrical model for the rings. Additionally, we used data from the HST science archives to check the evolution of the ORs of SN 1987A for a period that covers almost 11 years. We measured the flux in four different regions, two for each outer ring. We chose regions away from the two bright foreground stars, and as far as possible from the ER, and we created light curves for the emission lines of [O III], H\{$\backslash$alpha\}, and [N II]. The profiles of the lightcurves display a declining behaviour, which is consistent with the initial supernova flash powering of the ORs. The electron density of the emitting gas in the ORs, as estimated through nebular analysis from forbidden [O II] and [S II] lines, is <= 3*10\^{}3 cm\^{}-3, has not changed over the last \~{} 15 years, and also the [N II] temperature remains fairly constant at \~{} 1.2*10\^{}4 K. We find no obvious difference in density and temperature for the two ORs. The highest density, as measured from the decay of H\{$\backslash$alpha\}, could, however, be \~{} 5*10\^{}3 cm\^{}-3, and since the decay is somewhat faster for the southern outer ring than for the northern, the highest density in the ORs may be found in the southern outer ring. For an assumed distance of 50 kpc to the supernova, the distance between the supernova and the closest parts of the ORs could be as short as \~{} 1.7*10\^{}18 cm. Interaction between the supernova ejecta and the outer rings could therefore start in less than \~{} 20 years. We do not expect the ORs to show the same optical display as the equatorial ring when this happens.},

@article{Gall2014,
	Abstract = {The origin of dust in galaxies is still a mystery. The majority of the refractory elements are produced in supernova explosions, but it is unclear how and where dust grains condense and grow, and how they avoid destruction in the harsh environments of star-forming galaxies. The recent detection of 0.1 to 0.5 solar masses of dust in nearby supernova remnants suggests in situ dust formation, while other observations reveal very little dust in supernovae in the first few years after explosion. Observations of the spectral evolution of the bright SN 2010jl have been interpreted as pre-existing dust, dust formation or no dust at all. Here we report the rapid (40 to 240 days) formation of dust in its dense circumstellar medium. The wavelength-dependent extinction of this dust reveals the presence of very large (exceeding one micrometre) grains, which resist destruction. At later times (500 to 900 days), the near-infrared thermal emission shows an accelerated growth in dust mass, marking the transition of the dust source from the circumstellar medium to the ejecta. This provides the link between the early and late dust mass evolution in supernovae with dense circumstellar media.},

@article{Wang1996,
	Abstract = {We have used the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope to observe the spectra of SN 1987A over the wavelength range 2000 -- 8000$\backslash$ $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ on dates 1862 and 2210 days after the supernova outburst. Even these pre-COSTAR observations avoid much of the contamination from the bright stars nearby and provide a very useful set of line strengths and shapes for analysis. The spectrum is formed in an unusual physical setting: cold gas which is excited and ionized by energetic electrons from the radioactive debris of the supernova explosion. The spectra of SN 1987A at this phase are surprisingly similar to those of the nova shells of CP Puppis and T Pyxidis decades after outburst. SN 1987A and the novae are characterized by emission from material with electron temperatures of only a few hundred degrees Kelvin, and show narrow Balmer continuum emission and strong emission lines from O\$\^{}+\$. The Balmer continuum shape requires the electron temperature in the supernova ejecta to be as low as 500 K on day 1862 and 400 K on day 2210 after outburst. The $\backslash$OIIUV$\backslash$ doublet is surprisingly strong and is plausibly powered by collisional ionization of neutral oxygen to excited states of O\$\^{}+\$. The line intensity ratio of the $\backslash$OID$\backslash$ doublet obtained from Gaussian fits of the line profiles is 1.8\$\backslash pm0.2\$, contrary to the optically thin limit of 3. This ratio is \{$\backslash$it not\} due to an optical depth effect, but rather is an artifact of assuming a Gaussian profile to fit the $\backslash$OID$\backslash$ doublet profile. Specifying the line ratio \$R\backslash, = \backslash, F([\{\backslash rm OI\}]6300)/F([\{\backslash rm OI\}]6364)\$ = 3 is consistent with the data and allows a calculation of the decomposed line profile. All the observed strong lines are found to be blueshifted by a similar amount},

@article{Kozma1997,
	Abstract = {Using the temperature and ionization calculated in our previous paper, we model the spectral evolution of SN 1987A. The IR-catastrophe is seen in the metal lines as a transition from thermal to non-thermal excitation, most clearly in the [O I] 6300, 6364 lines. The distribution of the different zones, and therefore the gamma-ray deposition, is determined from the line profiles of the most important lines, where possible. We find the total mass of hydrogen-rich gas to be \~{}7.7 Msun. The helium mass derived from the line fluxes is sensitive to assumptions about the degree of redistribution in the line. The mass of the helium dominated zone is consistent with \~{}1.9 Msun, with a further \~{}3.9 Msun of helium residing in the hydrogen component. Because of uncertainties in the modeling of the non-thermal excitation of the [O I] lines, the uncertainty in the oxygen mass is considerable. In addition, masses of nitrogen, neon, magnesium, iron and nickel are estimated. The dominant contribution to the line luminosity often originates in a different zone from where most of the newly synthesized material resides. This applies to e.g. carbon, calcium and iron. The [C I] lines, mainly arising in the helium zone, indicate a substantially lower abundance of carbon mixed with helium than stellar evolution models give, and a more extended zone with CNO processed gas is indicated. The [Fe II] lines have in most phases a strong contribution from primordial iron, and at t > 600 - 800 days this component dominates the [Fe II] lines. The wings of the [Fe II] lines may therefore come from primordial iron, rather than synthesized iron mixed to high velocity. Lines from ions with low ionization potential indicate that the UV field below at least 1600 AA is severely quenched by dust absorption and resonance scattering.},

@article{Smith2012,
	Abstract = {Type IIn SNe show spectral evidence for strong interaction between their blast wave and dense circumstellar material (CSM) around the progenitor star. SN2010jl was the brightest core-collapse SN in 2010, and it was a Type IIn explosion with strong CSM interaction. Andrews et al. recently reported evidence for an IR excess in SN2010jl, indicating either new dust formation or the heating of CSM dust in an IR echo. Here we report multi-epoch spectra of SN2010jl that reveal the tell-tale signature of new dust formation: emission-line profiles becoming systematically more blueshifted as the red side of the line is blocked by increasing extinction. The effect is seen clearly in the intermediate-width (400--4000 km/s) component of H\$\backslash alpha\$ beginning roughly 30d after explosion. Moreover, we present near-IR spectra demonstrating that the asymmetry in the hydrogen-line profiles is wavelength dependent, appearing more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. This evidence suggests that new dust grains had formed quickly in the post-shock shell of SN 2010jl arising from CSM interaction. Since the observed dust temperature has been attributed to an IR echo and not to new dust, either (1) IR excess emission at \$\backslash lambda < 5 \backslash mu\$m is not a particularly sensitive tracer of new dust formation in SNe, or (2) some assumptions about expected dust temperatures might require further study. Lastly, we discuss one possible mechanism other than dust that might lead to increasingly blueshifted line profiles in SNeIIn, although the wavelength dependence of the asymmetry argues against this hypothesis in the case of SN2010jl.},

The influence of inhomogeneities on the derived mass-loss rates is then examined to develop ideas related to W-R stellar winds and stellar evolution. Existing evidence regarding electron-scattering wings in W-R stellar spectra is reviewed, and present models are found to be inadequate to describe the weak wings. Theoretical line profiles are computed by two separate methods, and the effect of an inhomogeneous density structure on the strength of the electron-scattering wings is examined. The line profiles and line strengths are similar to observed values except that the mean mass-loss rate is lower; the corresponding reduction in the strength of the wings shows that the mass-loss rates for W-R stars are overestimated.},

The observations reveal the presence of a population of cold dust grains radiating with a temperature of about 17 to 23 kelvin at a rate of about 220 times the luminosity of the Sun. The intensity and spectral energy distribution of the emission suggest a dust mass of about 0.4 to 0.7 times the mass of the Sun. The radiation must originate from the supernova ejecta and requires the efficient precipitation of all refractory material into dust. Our observations imply that supernovae can produce the large dust masses detected in young galaxies at very high redshifts.},

	Abstract = {High resolution spectra with UVES/VLT of SN 1987A from December 2000 until November 2005 show a number of high ionization lines from gas with velocities of roughly 350 km/s, emerging from the shocked gas formed by the ejecta-ring collision. These include coronal lines from [Fe X], [Fe XI] and [Fe XIV] which have increased by a factor of about 20 during the observed period. The evolution of the lines is similar to that of the soft X-rays, indicating that they arise in the same component. The line ratios are consistent with those expected from radiative shocks with velocity 310-390 km/s, corresponding to a shock temperature of (1.6-2.5) x 10\^{}6 K. A fraction of the coronal emission may, however, originate in higher velocity adiabatic shocks.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of the effects of clumping on the emergent spectral energy distribution (SED) from dusty supernova (SN) shells illuminated by a diffuse radiation source distributed throughout the medium. (...) The fully 3D radiation transport problem is solved using a Monte Carlo code, MOCASSIN, and we present a set of models aimed at investigating the sensitivity of the SEDs to various clumping parameters. We find that, contrary to the predictions of analytical prescriptions, the combination of an optical and IR observational data set is sufficient to constrain dust masses even in the case where optically thick clumps are present. Using both smoothly varying and clumped grain density distributions, we obtain new estimates for the mass of dust condensed by the Type II SN 1987A by fitting the optical and infrared spectrophotometric data of Wooden et al. (1993) at two epochs (day 615 and day 775). (...) From our numerical models we derive dust masses for SN 1987A that are comparable to previous analytic clumped graphite grain mass estimates, and at least two orders of magnitude below the 0.1-0.3 Msol that have been predicted to condense as dust grains in primordial core collapse supernova ejecta. This low condensation efficiency for SN 1987A is in contrast to the case of SN 2003gd, for which a dust condensation efficiency as large as 0.12 has recently been estimated. (Abridged)},

	Abstract = {The first results on the optical constants of three different amorphous carbon samples, possible analogues of interstellar and circumstellar dust grains, are presented. They have been deduced from recent laboratory data, making use of the Kramers-Kronig approach, It is shown that the physically correct simulation of clustering by the traditional `CDE' model is not applicable here. A modified CDE (MCDE) model is proposed and used in the present calculations. The MCDE model allows one to take into account the effect of percolation of the analysed amorphous carbon clusters through the parameter g(o), interpreted as a percolation strength, The intervals of the probable MCDE models (g(o)) have been chosen on the basis of the relevant estimates of Stognienko, Henning \& Ossenkopf for the cluster-cluster aggregation (CCA) and particle-cluster aggregation (PCA) models. The `optimal' percolation strengths and optical constants have been derived by using a least-squares procedure.},

	Abstract = {We discuss high resolution VLT/UVES observations (FWHM \~{} 6 km/s) from October 2002 (day \~{}5700 past explosion) of the shock interaction of SN 1987A and its circumstellar ring. A nebular analysis of the narrow lines from the unshocked gas indicates gas densities of (1.5-5.0)E3 cm-3 and temperatures of 6.5E3-2.4E4 K. This is consistent with the thermal widths of the lines. From the shocked component we observe a large range of ionization stages from neutral lines to [Fe XIV]. From a nebular analysis we find that the density in the low ionization region is 4E6-1E7 cm-3. There is a clear difference in the high velocity extension of the low ionization lines and that of lines from [Fe X-XIV], with the latter extending up to \~{} -390 km/s in the blue wing for [Fe XIV], while the low ionization lines extend to typically \~{} -260 km/s. For H-alpha a faint extension up to \~{} -450 km/s can be seen probably arising from a small fraction of shocked high density clumps. We discuss these observations in the context of radiative shock models, which are qualitatively consistent with the observations. A fraction of the high ionization lines may originate in gas which has yet not had time to cool down, explaining the difference in width between the low and high ionization lines. The maximum shock velocities seen in the optical lines are \~{} 510 km/s. We expect the maximum width of especially the low ionization lines to increase with time.},
