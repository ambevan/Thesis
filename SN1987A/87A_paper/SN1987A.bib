abstract = {We investigate high-resolution line profiles of H$\alpha$, [Fe II] 7155A$\backslash$nand Ca II] 7291,7323 A in the spectra of SN 1987A. We identify a common$\backslash$nprominent narrow feature in all four lines. We attribute the emission to$\backslash$na fast knot of metals and hydrogen. Our observations provide the first$\backslash$ndirect evidence for mixing on a small as well as a large scale in the$\backslash$nejecta of SN 1987A. Our observations support the idea that such knots$\backslash$nmay well have contributed the bulk of the emission of the supernova$\backslash$nafter the ejecta cooled and dust formed at about day 500. The ratio of$\backslash$nthe two components of the blend of Ca II] 7291,7323A provides an upper$\backslash$nlimit on the number density of Ca\^{}+\^{} of 1 x 10\^{}5\^{} cm\^{}-3\^{} on day 673 for$\backslash$nboth the knot and the rest of the ejecta.},

@article{Kozma1997,
abstract = {Using the temperature and ionization calculated in our previous paper, we model the spectral evolution of SN 1987A. The IR-catastrophe is seen in the metal lines as a transition from thermal to non-thermal excitation, most clearly in the [O I] 6300, 6364 lines. The distribution of the different zones, and therefore the gamma-ray deposition, is determined from the line profiles of the most important lines, where possible. We find the total mass of hydrogen-rich gas to be \~{}7.7 Msun. The helium mass derived from the line fluxes is sensitive to assumptions about the degree of redistribution in the line. The mass of the helium dominated zone is consistent with \~{}1.9 Msun, with a further \~{}3.9 Msun of helium residing in the hydrogen component. Because of uncertainties in the modeling of the non-thermal excitation of the [O I] lines, the uncertainty in the oxygen mass is considerable. In addition, masses of nitrogen, neon, magnesium, iron and nickel are estimated. The dominant contribution to the line luminosity often originates in a different zone from where most of the newly synthesized material resides. This applies to e.g. carbon, calcium and iron. The [C I] lines, mainly arising in the helium zone, indicate a substantially lower abundance of carbon mixed with helium than stellar evolution models give, and a more extended zone with CNO processed gas is indicated. The [Fe II] lines have in most phases a strong contribution from primordial iron, and at t > 600 - 800 days this component dominates the [Fe II] lines. The wings of the [Fe II] lines may therefore come from primordial iron, rather than synthesized iron mixed to high velocity. Lines from ions with low ionization potential indicate that the UV field below at least 1600 AA is severely quenched by dust absorption and resonance scattering.},

@article{Ercolano2007,
abstract = {We present a study of the effects of clumping on the emergent spectral energy distribution (SED) from dusty supernova (SN) shells illuminated by a diffuse radiation source distributed throughout the medium. (...) The fully 3D radiation transport problem is solved using a Monte Carlo code, MOCASSIN, and we present a set of models aimed at investigating the sensitivity of the SEDs to various clumping parameters. We find that, contrary to the predictions of analytical prescriptions, the combination of an optical and IR observational data set is sufficient to constrain dust masses even in the case where optically thick clumps are present. Using both smoothly varying and clumped grain density distributions, we obtain new estimates for the mass of dust condensed by the Type II SN 1987A by fitting the optical and infrared spectrophotometric data of Wooden et al. (1993) at two epochs (day 615 and day 775). (...) From our numerical models we derive dust masses for SN 1987A that are comparable to previous analytic clumped graphite grain mass estimates, and at least two orders of magnitude below the 0.1-0.3 Msol that have been predicted to condense as dust grains in primordial core collapse supernova ejecta. This low condensation efficiency for SN 1987A is in contrast to the case of SN 2003gd, for which a dust condensation efficiency as large as 0.12 has recently been estimated. (Abridged)},

abstract = {Model calculations are presented to fit the evolution of the intensity and profile of the forbidden O I 6300, 6364 emission doublet observed in the spectrum of SN 1987A. The fact that the doublet ratio R = F(6300)/F(6364) is less than 3 is evidence that these lines are optically thick for t of approximately less than 1 yr after outburst. The oxygen is theorized to be distributed in a clumpy fashion throughout the supernova envelope. The data is fitted with a three-zone model having 1.3 solar mass of oxygen distributed within a freely expanding sphere with a volume fitting factor f of about 0.1. The temperature of the oxygen changed from about 4100 K at day 200 to about 2900 K at day 500.},
